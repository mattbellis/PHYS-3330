         Transistors - General Use</h1>
         <p>An electrical signal can be amplified using a device that
         allows a small current or voltage to control the flow of a much
         larger current from a DC power source. Transistors are the
         basic devices providing control of this kind. There are two
         general types of transistors, bipolar and field-effect. The
         difference between these two types is that for bipolar devices
         an input current controls the large current flow through the
         device, while for field-effect transistors an input voltage
         provides the current control. In this experiment we will build
         a two-stage amplifier using two bipolar transistors.</p>
         <p>In many practical applications it is better to use an op-amp
         as a source of gain rather than to build an amplifier from
         discrete transistors. A good understanding of transistor
         fundamentals is nevertheless essential because op-amps are
         built from transistors. We will learn later about digital
         circuits, which are also made from transistors. In addition to
         the importance of transistors as components of op-amps, digital
         circuits, and an enormous variety of other integrated circuits,
         single transistors (usually called “discrete” transistors) are
         used in many applications. They are important as interface
         devices between integrated circuits and sensors, indicators,
         and other devices used to communicate with the outside world.
         High-performance amplifiers operating from DC through microwave
         frequencies use discrete transistor “front-ends” to achieve the
         lowest possible noise. Discrete transistors are generally much
         faster than op-amps. The device we will use this week has a
         gain-bandwidth product of 300 MHz (compared to 5 MHz for the
         LF356 op-amp you have been using).</p>
         <p>The three terminals of a bipolar transistor are called the
         emitter, base, and collector (Figure <a href="#fig:NPN">1</a>).
         A small current into the base controls a large current flow
         from the collector to the emitter. The current at the base is
         typically about 1% of the collector-emitter current. This means
         that the transistor acts as a current amplifier with a typical
         current gain (<span class="math inline">\(h_{fe}\)</span> or
         <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>) of about 100.
         Moreover, the large collector current flow is almost
         independent of the voltage across the transistor from collector
         to emitter. This makes it possible to obtain a large
         amplification of voltage by having the collector current flow
         through a resistor.</p>

         class="header-section-number">4</span> Current Amplifier Model
         of a Bipolar Transistor</h1>
         <p>From the simplest point of view a bipolar transistor is a
         current amplifier. The current flowing from collector to
         emitter is equal to the base current multiplied by a factor. An
         NPN transistor like the 2N3904 operates with the collector
         voltage at least a few tenths of a volt above the emitter, and
         with a current flowing into the base. There are also PNP
         transistors with opposite polarity voltages and currents. The
         base-emitter junction acts like a forward-biased diode with a
         0.6 V drop:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_E \approx
         V_B-0.6~V\]</span></p>
         <p>Under these conditions, the collector current is
         proportional to the base current:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[I_C = h_{fe}I_B\]</span></p>
         <p>The constant of proportionality (‘current gain’) is called
         <span class="math inline">\(h_{fe}\)</span> because it is one
         of the "h-parameters", which are a set of numbers that give a
         complete description of the small-signal properties of a
         transistor. It is important to keep in mind that hfe is not
         really a constant. It depends on collector current, and it can
         vary by 50% or more from device to device.</p>
         <p>If you want to know the emitter current, rather than the
         collector current, you can find it by current conservation:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[I_E = I_B+I_C =
         I_C\left(\frac{1}{h_{fe}+1}\right)\]</span></p>
         <p>The difference between <span
         class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> and <span
         class="math inline">\(I_E\)</span> is almost never important
         since <span class="math inline">\(h_{fe}\)</span> is normally
         in the range of 100–1000, so you can generally assume that
         <span class="math inline">\(I_E\)</span> = <span
         class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span>. Another way to say this is
         that the base current is very small compared to the collector
         and emitter currents.</p>

         id="emitter-follower-and-common-emitter-amplifier"><span
         class="header-section-number">5</span> Emitter Follower and
         Common Emitter Amplifier</h1>
         <p>We will begin by constructing a common emitter amplifier
         (CEA), which operates on the principle of a current amplifier.
         However, a major fault of the common emitter amplifier is its
         high output impedance. This problem can be fixed by adding a
         second circuit, the emitter follower (EF), as a second stage.
         The common-emitter amplifier and the emitter follower are the
         most common bipolar transistor circuits.</p>
         <p>First consider the emitter follower (Figure <a
         href="#fig:emitterf">2</a>). The output (emitter) voltage is
         always 0.6 V (one diode drop) below the input (base) voltage. A
         small AC signal of amplitude <span
         class="math inline">\(v_{in}\)</span> at the input will
         therefore give a signal <span
         class="math inline">\(v_{in}\)</span> at the output, i.e. the
         output just “follows” the input. There is no gain (the gain is
         1) but we will see later that this circuit is still useful
         because it has high input impedance and low output
         impedance.</p>
         <p>Now consider the common emitter amplifier (Figure <a
         href="#fig:emittera">3</a>). A small AC signal of amplitude
         <span class="math inline">\(v_{in}\)</span> at the input will
         give the same AC signal <span
         class="math inline">\(v_{in}\)</span> at the emitter (just like
         the emitter follower). This will cause a varying current of
         amplitude <span class="math inline">\(v_{in}/R_E\)</span> to
         flow from the emitter to ground. As we found above, <span
         class="math inline">\(I_E\gg I_C\)</span>, and so the same
         current will flow through <span
         class="math inline">\(R_C\)</span>. This current generates
         <span class="math inline">\(v_{out} =
         –R_C(v_{in}/R_E)\)</span>. Thus, the common emitter stage has a
         small-signal AC voltage gain of:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[G=\frac{-R_C}{R_E}\]</span></p>
         <p><strong>Note:</strong> this gain is about the change in
         voltage, which is a bit different than the gains you have been
         working with so far.</p>

         Amplifier</h1>
         <p>Figure <a href="#fig:emittera">3</a> shows the basic common
         emitter amplifier, while Figure <a href="#fig:emitterabn">4</a>
         shows the common emitter amplifier circuit that you will build
         with the biasing resistors, power filter capacitor, and
         coupling capacitors in place. The power filter capacitor
         connecting +15 V to ground serves to ensure that electronic
         noise from the power supply does not enter the circuit. The
         coupling capacitors on the input and output serve to transmit
         the AC signal and block the DC voltage. For the input, this is
         essential because if you feed DC voltage into something
         providing its own voltage, bad things will happen. In this
         case, if the biasing DC voltage is directly connected to the
         output of the function generator (<span
         class="math inline">\(V_{in}\)</span>) the output buffer in the
         function generator will break. For the output, the coupling
         capacitor is simply convenient as we don’t care about the DC
         voltages, just the AC signal.</p>

         <p>This brings us to the biasing network. While we are usually
         trying to amplify a small AC signal, it is essential that we
         setup the proper “quiescent point” or bias voltages. These are
         the DC voltages present when the signal is zero. Setting up the
         proper biasing often requires an iterative process. Here are
         the steps to understand what is happening in a transistor
         setup.</p>

         <p><strong>Maximum voltage:</strong> This occurs when the

         Since the left side is connected to a positive DC voltage of
         <span class="math inline">\(V_C\)</span> and the right side
         will be connected to ground through the scope, you should have
         the negative side (the one that is marked and has the shorter
         lead) on the right. Move your scope measurement to occur after
         <span class="math inline">\(C_{out}\)</span>. When you first
         turn it on, you may find that the output voltage has a large DC
         offset due to charging of the output coupling capacitor. This
         should discharge since the scope provides a 1 MW path to ground
         but if it doesn’t, you can add a 220 kW resistor to ground
         after <span class="math inline">\(C_{out}\)</span>. Check that
         the output now oscillates around 0 V with the scope channel set
         to DC coupling.</li>
         <li>Measure the gain of the amplifier for 10 kHz sine waves
         using an amplitude that ensures the voltages are less than half
         of the clipping voltage (either positive or negative). You
         should use the 10X scope probe for measuring the output. Does
         your measurement agree with your prediction? Screen shots here
         would be good.</li>

         the results of both speaker tests. Does the gain provided by
         the common emitter amplifier result in a louder tone from the

         already has a value suitable for biasing the emitter follower,
         so a direct DC connection can be made between the two circuits.
         Add the emitter follower to your circuit to build the dual

         What is the gain of the full circuit? What is the gain of just

         <span class="math inline">\(C_{out}\)</span> to keep the DC
         level near ground as the large output capacitor can slowly
         charge up. You may also want to put the scope on AC coupling
