         <p>Today you will learn to use equipment that are useful for
         building and testing electronic circuits. You will use all of
         these instruments extensively throughout the semester.</p>
         <ul>
         <li>Power supply
         <ul>
         <li>This is used to provide DC power to your circuits</li>
         <li>It can be used as a voltage source (constant voltage) or a
         current source (constant current)</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>Function generator
         <ul>
         <li>This is used to create signals with various waveforms</li>
         <li>This is an incredibly useful tool for characterizing,
         testing, and prototyping circuits</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>Digital multimeter (DMM)
         <ul>
         <li>This is an extremely versitile tool that can measure DC and
         AC voltages and currents, resistances, and sometimes more
         (depending on the model)</li>
         <li>It has a simple display that can only show single values
         such as a root-mean-square voltage of an AC signal.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>Oscilloscope
         <ul>
         <li>This is a voltage meter that can “plot” voltage over
         time.</li>
         <li>This is a far more powerful tool for characterizing
         voltages than the DMM because you can characterize wave shapes
         and noise</li>
         </ul></li>
         </ul>
         <!--
         *** added "further" to imply continuation. some other minor edits 
         -->
         <p>In this course you will further develop essential laboratory
         skills. Not only is the above equipment found in nearly every
         lab space, but you will practice keeping a lab notebook in a
         practical way and practice a model based approach to
         experimental design.</p>
         <!-- 
         *** had difficulty parsing the feedback for this part, but I think I improved it
         -->
         <p>In this course, you will practice implementing models,
         testing those models, and refining them when necessary.
         Extremely accurate and nuanced models are often difficult to
         implement because they rely on more complicated and difficult
         to solve mathematics. Balancing accuracy and simplicity is a
         skill and takes practice.</p>
         <p>In this guided lab, you will learn how to</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Tie (connect) your circuit to <em>Earth
         ground</em>,</p></li>
         <li><p>Set up the power supply so that you can get positive and
         negative voltages (relative to ground),</p></li>
         <li><p>Operate the power supply in constant voltage and
         constant current modes,</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure physical properties, such as voltage, current,
         and resistance,</p></li>
         <li><p>Trigger the oscilliscope,</p></li>
         <li><p>Operate the function generator,</p></li>
         </ul>
         <!--
         *** added this 
         -->
         <ul>
         <li><p>Use a micrometer to measure the diameter of a wire and
         estimate the resistivity,</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure resistors using 2-terminal and 4-terminal
         measurement methods,</p></li>
         <li><p>Develop familiarity with the model-based approach to
         experiment.</p></li>
         </ul>

         class="header-section-number">2</span> Lab Notebook
         Guidelines</h1>
         <p>Lab notebooks are an essential tool in research and
         development settings. They may seem tedious to maintain, but if
         you develop good habits now, you will avoid unecessary
         headaches in the future. Poor notetaking can force you to
         unecessarily repeat experiments and/or calculations.</p>
         <p>In this course, the lab notebook will play an essential role
         and it will be graded each week. You will use your notebook for
         keeping records of many things including:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Answering prelab questions from the lab guide to prepare
         you for upcoming lab activities,</p></li>
         <li><p>Answering in-lab questions,</p></li>
         <li><p>Measurements and data,</p></li>
         <li><p>Plots, diagrams, pictures, and sketches,</p></li>
         <li><p>Experimental procedures and designs,</p></li>
         <li><p>Analyses and results.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>The lab notebook will be an important part of your grade
         because learning to keep a good lab notebook is crucial for
         your professional development. Keeping a physical notebook is
         very common, but many people like to keep digital notebooks
         nowadays. There are many popular tools; since the University
         now uses a Microsoft ecosystem, OneNote ends up being very
         convenient for integrating with other Microsoft tools such as
         Teams and OneDrive. Jupyter notebooks are another useful tool
         as they can integrate Python code which can streamline your
         calculations and allow for nice and easy plots. Your lab
         notebook is the main mechanism for communicating your processes
         and results of the lab experiments. Each week, you will be
         responsible for turning in both your pre-laboratory work and
         your lab notebook / analyses via Canvas in scanned format. See
         the syllabus for more information.</p>
         <!--You may find it helpful to write up many of your notes on the computer, for example, within Mathematica, Jupyter Notebooks. This is fine. However, before your notebook is turned in, the notes, plots, and analysis should be transferred to the lab notebook by printing and taping the pages or keeping them in a three-ring binder. This is standard practice in research labs. Your lab notebook is the main mechanism for communicating your process and results of the lab experiments. Each week, you will be responsible for turning in both your pre-laboratory work and your lab notebook / analysis via Canvas in scanned format. See the syllabus for more information.-->

         class="header-section-number">4</span> Some Useful
         Definitions</h1>
         <p><strong>Common ground</strong> - there are many types of
         ground and people often confuse them and use the word “ground”
         to refer to any one of them. A common ground is any part of a
         circuit which is (arbitrarily) referred to as <span
         class="math inline">\(0\text{ V}\)</span> and that all other
         voltages are measured with respect to.</p>
         <p><strong>Earth ground</strong> - a common ground which is
         ultimately connected to the Earth. The 3<sup>rd</sup> round
         prong on wall outlets is Earth ground. Under buildings, large
         metal plates or rods are buried and are connected to via a
         <em>ground wire</em>. Earth ground allows for certain kinds of
         short circuit failures (and lightning strikes) to have the
         power diverted away and avoid excessive damage to devices,
         buildings, and people.</p>
         <p><strong>Chassis ground</strong> - a common ground which is a
         metal frame around the circuit. If a device plugs into the wall
         with 3 prongs, it <em>should</em> have the chassis connect to
         <strong>Earth ground</strong>. Chassis grounding can help
         facilitate the safety of Earth grounding, but also acts a
         Faraday cage, shielding the circuit from external EM waves.</p>
         <p><strong>Electrical Load</strong> - a load refers to the
         impedance (in ohms) connected to the output of a power source.
         This could be a speaker, a light bulb, a microwave oven, or
         anything else which is drawing power from the circuit.</p>
         <p><strong>RMS (Root Mean Square)</strong> - the square root of
         the average of a periodic function squared over one period
         <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{RMS}=\sqrt{\langle
         V(t)^{2}\rangle}\)</span>. Example: For the function <span
         class="math inline">\(V(t) = V_0\sin(\omega t)\)</span>, the
         RMS value is <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{RMS} =
         \large\frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}}\)</span>.</p>
         <p><em>Note:</em> <span
         class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\approx
         0.707\)</span>. This number will come up <strong>a lot</strong>
         in this course, and is worth committing to memory!</p>

         <p><em>IMPORTANT NOTE:</em> In this course’s guided lab
         manuals, “ground” refers to Earth ground; other kinds of ground
         will be explicitly differentiated.</p>

         class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Power Supply</h2>
         <p>Your DC power supply will provide your circuits with the
         required power. Setting up the power supply will almost always
         be the first thing you do when you begin working with a
         circuit. The Keysight EDU36311A DC Power Supply has
         <strong>three</strong> outputs that can be independently
         controlled. Pages 43-45 of the User Guide (which can be found
         in the <a href="/PHYS-3330/manuals-data-sheets">Data Sheets and
         Instrument Manuals page</a>) discuss this in detail.</p>
         <h3 data-number="6.1.1" id="set-up-the-dc-voltage-bias"><span
         class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> Set up the DC
         voltage bias</h3>
         <p>We want two of the power supply channels to be set up such
         that the potential difference (voltage) set on one of the
         channels is <strong><em><span
         style="color: red;">positive</span></em></strong> <strong>with
         respect to ground</strong> and the other is <strong><em><span
         style="color: blue;">negative</span></em></strong> <strong>with
         respect to ground</strong>.</p>
         <p>By default, all 3 outputs are
         <strong><em>FLOATING</em></strong> with respect to ground. You
         have to manually connect one of the terminals of a channel’s
         output to ground in order to “tie” it to ground. This gives you
         the flexibility to use the power supply in a number of
         different ways.</p>
         <p>For example: when you set <span
         class="math inline">\(5\text{ V}\)</span> on Channel 2, the
         power supply will make the <span
         class="math inline">\((+)\)</span> terminal <span
         class="math inline">\(5\text{ V}\)</span> above the <span
         class="math inline">\((-)\)</span> terminal. In order to get
         <span class="math inline">\(\pm 5\text{ V}\)</span>
         <strong>relative to ground</strong>, you will need to connect
         one of these terminals to the ground terminal.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Get some <strong><span
         style="color: green;">green</span></strong> wire from the wire
         spool rack on the top of the blue tool cabinet to make these
         grounding connections. Connect Channel 2’s <span
         class="math inline">\((-)\)</span> terminal to ground and
         Channel 3’s <span class="math inline">\((+)\)</span> terminal
         to ground (see the green lines drawn on Figure <a
         href="#fig:ps">6</a>). You can unscrew the input jacks on the
         power supply to expose a small hole where the jumper wires can
         be inserted. <!--

         *** I hadn't considered this in detail, but now that you mention it: for single phase AC, hot is black, neutral is white, and ground is green. For DC red is positive, and black is negative: which I believe implies just 2 voltages. Since we use 3 voltages DC, I think the best way to comply with other standards would be for

         Green - Ground

         White - Neutral

         Red - DC above ground

         Black - DC below ground

         *** This way, Red and Black which are both considered "HOT" in some standard, are both considered "hot", and green is considered "cold".

         *** The distinction between neutral and ground being that, even though they are the same voltage, the ground wire is not connected to a load. In this way, making green connections from the ground port to the + and - ports of the outputs and a white wire from the power supply to the bread board would probably be the most "compliant" with safety standards. 

         [//]: # (We harp on that black is ground in this course - I'm not certain why that was historically done here and I'm certainly on board to converting to conventional standards (including shifting red to white and blue to black {I might have that backwords}). But, we should change all the proto board connections to be consistent? Buy a bunch of green banana cables? I'm genuinely in favor of this and it will require revisions to subsequent lab guides.)

         Predict what the voltages will be at each of the 4 output
         terminals (whenever someone refers to a voltage at a location,
         they always mean “relative to ground”).</p></li>

         <p>But as the load <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>
         changes, either the voltage or the current will have to adjust.
         A <em>voltage source</em> supplies a <em>constant voltage</em>
         (the current changes), and a <em>current source</em> supplies a
         <em>constant current</em> (the voltage changes).
         Mathematically:</p>

         <li><p>Voltage source: <span class="math inline">\(I(R) =

         source. When it is a voltage source, it will display

         source, it will display <strong>CC</strong> for <em>constant

         class="header-section-number">6.2</span> The Oscilloscope
         (Scope)</h2>
         <p>The goal of this part of the lab is to be able to use an
         oscilloscope (aka scope or o-scope) to make voltage
         measurements over time. Old, analog scopes scanned an electron
         beam horizontally across fluorescent screen, and applying a
         voltage at the input would cause the beam to deflect up and
         down with the voltage, allowing you to visualize how the
         voltage behaved over time. Today, most labs are equipped with
         digital oscilliscopes which rapidly measure the voltage and
         then plot the data on a screen in real time. This has many
         advantages over using the DMM as a voltmeter because it gives
         you much more information about the voltage you’re
         measuring.</p>
         <p>There are a few precautions to observe when operating the
         oscilloscope:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>Avoid overheating the instrument. Do not block ventilation
         of the interior.</li>
         <li>Do not apply more than 300 V to any input terminal.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Otherwise, the instruments are robust and cannot be damaged
         by wrong settings. So, try whatever you’re curious about and
         measure and document what happens.</p>

         <p><span style="color: red;">There is one main
         <strong>precaution</strong> to keep in mind: <strong><em>Do not
         connect any output of the EDU33212A directly to DC

         a later labs, we’ll learn how to use different tools to allow
         you to safely interface the function generator with DC
         power.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>The function generator has an output impedance of <span
         class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span>, and it assumes, by
         default, that you will use a <span class="math inline">\(50\
         \Omega\)</span> load. This means that half of the voltage will
         drop across the output impedance, and half will drop across the
         load, so by default, the function generator displays only half
         the voltage that it is actually trying to apply (becuase this
         is how much “reaches” the load). <span

         <p>In order to view waves on the oscilliscope, it needs to
         redraw the wave in the right place at the right time.
         “Triggering” is the process of stabilizing a repeating signal
         on the screen.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Use a BNC connector to connect the output of the
         function generator to the input of Channel 1 on the
         scope.</p></li>
         <li><p>Set the <em>voltage / div</em> and <em>time / div</em>
         so that the sine wave appears nice and big on the screen.
         Remember that the period is the inverse of the frequency.
         Always consider the frequency you are using and adjust the
         scope’s horizontal scale appropriately to avoid aliasing! Talk
         with an instructor to learn more about aliasing.</p></li>
         <li><p>The <strong>Trigger</strong> options are in the
         top-right corner of the front panel. Open the <em>Trigger
         Menu</em>. You should see that the channel the scope is
         triggering on is Channel 1.</p></li>
         <li><p>There are 3 options that you will change most regularly.
         Paraphrase these in your lab notebook for future reference.</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p><strong>Trigger channel:</strong> the input that the
         scope uses to trigger (this setting can be changed by pressing
         the vertical-scale knob corresponding to the channel you want
         to trigger to).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Trigger level:</strong> the scope knows to
         trigger the wave when the voltage changes through the trigger
         level voltage (this setting can be changed with the
         <em>Level</em> knob below the <em>Trigger Menu</em>
         button).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Slope:</strong> selects whether to trigger when
         the voltage rises to the trigger level (rising edge), or falls
         to the trigger level (falling edge).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Trigger mode:</strong> of the modes, there are 2
         you will mostly use for this class:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p><strong>Auto (untriggered roll)</strong>: This setting
         is needed to measure DC voltages that don’t pass through a
         trigger level. It does a poor job of triggering on slower waves
         (less than a few hundred <span
         class="math inline">\(\text{Hz}\)</span>).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Normal:</strong> If no trigger even occurs,
         nothing will be displayed (so measuring DC can’t be done). But
         this setting allows you to trigger on slower waves.</p></li>
         </ol></li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><p>Change the trigger channel. Since there is nothing to
         trigger on on other channels, you will see that the wave no
         longer displays in a measurable way (this is what “untriggered”
         looks like). Describe what you see. Change the trigger channel
         back to Channel 1.</p></li>
         <li><p>Play with the trigger level. Describe what you see. Why
         does this happen? Get help if you don’t understand.</p></li>
         <li><p>Press the slope button to change between rising and
         falling edge triggering. Desribe what happens (<em>Hint:</em>
         the wave is <strong>not</strong> “flipping”).</p></li>
         <li><p>Set the trigger level to <span
         class="math inline">\(-400\text{ mV}\)</span>. Is the wave
         still triggered? If not, increase the trigger level until it
         is.</p></li>
         <li><p>On the function generator, change the amplitude to <span
         class="math inline">\(100\text{ mV}_\text{pp}\)</span>. The
         waveform should no longer be triggered. Why?</p></li>
         <li><p>It is annoying to have to adjust the trigger every time
         you adjust your waveform. To accomodate this, the function
         generator has an output specifically for triggering on:
         <strong>Sync / Trigger out</strong> (just to the left of the
         Channel 1 output).</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Use a coax cable to connect this output to Channel 4 of
         the scope.</p></li>
         <li><p>Turn on Channel 4 on the scope.</p></li>
         <li><p>Adjust the vertical scale to fully view the waveform. A
         good habit is to have the wave occupy roughly 75% of the screen
         vertically.</p></li>
         <li><p>Describe the waveshape.</p></li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><p>Change the trigger channel to Channel 4. Adjust the
         trigger level. Does the trigger level matter? Why?</p></li>
         <li><p>Play with the waveform (from Channel 1) on the function
         generator. What happens to the <strong>Sync / Trigger
         out</strong> when you change</p>
         <ul>

         4.  The DMM also has an AC voltage setting. You will need to use the function generator to produce an AC (sine) waveform. Over what frequency range is the reading accurate to 2%?  Note: the DMM displays the RMS amplitude of the waveform. See Definitions at the beginning of the guide for an explanation of RMS. You will also need to consider how [“Amplitude” and “Peak-to-Peak”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude) are related.

         2-terminal measurement because you are using the same 2
         terminals to supply the current and measure the voltage. You

         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Trigger knob changes the voltage level of the
         trigger</p></li>
         <li><p>Trigger MENU button</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Select which channel to trigger off of (trigger level
         arrow changes color to show which channel is being triggered).
         You can also change the trigger channel by pressing the
         vertical scale knobs like buttons.</p></li>
         <li><p>Slope: can trigger off a rising or falling
         edge.</p></li>
         <li><p>Trigger Mode:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Auto: (will display a “roll” of measurements when not
         triggered). This setting will cause the wave to crawl across
         the screen at low frequencies.</p></li>
         <li><p>Normal: (won’t update the display if not triggered).
         This setting will not allow you to display DC without an
         external trigger source.</p></li>
         </ul></li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><p>The “Force Trigger” button should be avoided. If you’re
         having trouble triggering, this button often won’t help, and it
         will stunt your growth with regards to learning how to use the
         scope properly!</p></li>

         <p><strong>Measure Menu (top of panel):</strong></p>
         <p>You can select various operations to perform on the

         these because they can be very deceptive and may not give the
         result you are expecting, and how you display the wave on the
         screen greatly affects the number that “Measure” will report.
         Generally use cursors to make accurate measurements.</p>
         <p><strong>Cursor Menu (under Navigation):</strong></p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Choose time (vertical bars) or voltage (horizontal bars)
         measurement.</p></li>

         the same color as the channel they are measuring). You can
         change the channel by pressing the numbered channel
         button.</p></li>
         <li><p>Big top knob moves the cursors. You can press “Fine” to
         make it move more smoothly (this will also cause other knobs to
         move more smoothly which can be very annoying).</p></li>
         <li><p>Press the knob like a button to switch cursors.</p></li>
         <li><p>Position relative to ground (trigger zero time) is
         displayed on the screen with the T symbol.</p></li>
         <li><p>Relative distance between cursors is displayed on the
