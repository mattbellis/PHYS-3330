         <p>As discussed in the last lab, transistors are the basic
         devices providing control of large currents with small signals.
         There are two general types of transistors, bipolar and
         field-effect. The difference between these two types is that
         for bipolar devices an <em>input current</em> controls the
         large current flow through the device, while for field-effect
         transistors an <em>input voltage</em> provides the current
         control. In the last experiment, you used the transistor as a
         voltage amplifier. In the present experiment, you explore using
         the FET type transistors as a current controller to create an
         electromagnet.</p>

         <p>The input to a FET is called the gate (see Figure <a
         href="#fig:mosfetpo">2</a>), analogous to the base of a bipolar
         transistor. But unlike the situation with bipolar transistors,
         almost no current flows into the gate, and FETs are nearly
         ideal voltage amplifiers with very high input impedance. In
         junction FETs (JFETs) the gate is connected to the rest of the
         device through a reverse-biased pn junction, while in
         metal-oxide-semiconductor FETs (MOSFETs) the gate is connected
         via a thin insulating oxide layer. Bipolar transistors come in
         two polarities called npn and pnp, and similarly FETs come in
         two polarities called n-channel and p-channel.</p>
         <p>In integrated circuit form, small MOSFETs are ubiquitous in
         digital electronics, used in everything from simple logic
         circuits to the 2.5-billion transistor Intel 10-core Xeon
         processor chip. Small MOSFETs are also used in some op-amps,
         particularly when very low supply current is needed, as in
         portable battery-powered circuits. Small discrete (single)
         MOSFETs are not normally used because they are extremely
         fragile. Large discrete MOSFETs are used in all sorts of high
         power applications, including commercial radio
         transmitters.</p>
         <p>JFETs add very little intrinsic noise to a circuit, and a
         JFET input op-amp is often the first choice for low-noise
         amplification. Discrete JFETs are commonly seen in scientific
         instruments. Consider using a JFET when low-noise is critical.
         While we will not be exploring this feature in the current lab,
         you might consider this for a future project.</p>
         <h1 data-number="4" id="mosfet-current-voltage-relations"><span
         class="header-section-number">4</span> MOSFET Current-Voltage
         Relations</h1>
         <p>MOSFETs can operate in three distinct regions. The first
         region is where the gate-to-source voltage, <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{GS}\)</span>, is less than the
         threshold voltage, <span class="math inline">\(V_{th}\)</span>.
         In this region, the MOSFET is turned off and no current can
         flow. The second region is when <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{GS} &gt; V_{th}\)</span> and <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{DS} &lt; (V_{GS} ~–~ V_{th})\)</span>.
         In this linear region, the transistor is turned on, and a
         channel has been created that allows current to flow between
         the drain and the source. In this region, the MOSFET operates
         like a resistor, controlled by the gate voltage relative to
         both the source and drain voltages. In the third region, <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{GS} &gt; V_{th}\)</span> and <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{DS} \ge (V_{GS} - V_{th})\)</span>.
         This is called the saturation region. Here the current is
         controlled by the gate voltage and is nearly independent of
         <span class="math inline">\(V_{DS}\)</span>. We will work in
         the saturation region for this lab. The linear and saturation
         regions are separated by the dotted line in Figure <span
         class="citation"
         data-cites="figmosfetchar">@figmosfetchar</span>. In the
         saturation region, the dependence of current on <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{GS}\)</span> is modeled by <span
         class="math inline">\(I_D = k(V_{GS} ~–~V_{th})^2\)</span>,
         where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a constant that
         depends on the device.</p>

         <ol type="1">
         <li>Build the circuit shown in Figure <a
         href="#fig:magcircuit">4</a> using your coil.</li>
         <li>Using the data you acquired in section <a
         href="#sec:fetchar">8.1</a>, determine <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{supply}\)</span> and <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{GS}\)</span> to operate your
         electromagnet with 1 A of current in the saturation region.
         Remember to include the voltage drop across your coil in your
         calculations (HINT: <span class="math inline">\(V_{DS} =
         V_{supply} ~–~ I_DR_{coil}\)</span>). To reduce the heat load
         on the FET, you should use the minimum <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{supply}\)</span> that fulfills the
         requirements.</li>
         <li>Test out your electromagnet. Choose a way to test your
         model of the magnetic field produced. Explain the model you are
         testing and what your predictions are (even qualitative, such
         as how things scale).</li>
         <li>Describe your procedures, results/measurements, and
         refinements to your model. Some starter suggestions are listed
         below. Be creative! You should try a few different things:
         <ul>
         <li>Measure the magnetic field as a function of distance from
         the plane of the loop using the Gaussmeter in lab (or a
         magnetometer app on your phone). You can also slide the wire
         loops off-center and see the dependence.</li>
         <li>Look at the force applied by a permanent magnet on the coil
         and see how that scales with current or number of turns.</li>
         <li>By changing <span class="math inline">\(V_{GS}\)</span>,
         you can vary the current through the coil. Measure the field
         strength as a function of the current.</li>
         <li>Vary the number of turns on your loop of wire and verify
         the dependence.</li>
         <li>Slide a screwdriver (steel) or another steel rod into the
         coil and report what happens.</li>
         <li>Check the effect of your coil on a compass and compare to
         the known magnetic field of the Earth.</li>
         <li>Get a power supply that can supply more current and pick up
         objects, test how the number or weight of objects you can pick
         up depends on the current.</li>
         <li>Wrap your coil around an iron core and test how the
         magnetic field changes, refine your model to include the
         iron</li>
         </ul></li>
