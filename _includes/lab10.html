         Introduction</h1>
         <p>Suppose you want to build something more complex than the
         digital circuits we studied in the previous experiment. For
         example, you might have a photodiode that you want to hook up
         to a computer so you can automatically adjust your experiment
         in response to changing light intensity, maybe by adjusting the
         current powering a laser. Or, say you want to build a tiny,
         battery-powered data transmitter to feed to a dolphin and find
         out how her body temperature varies while she’s swimming around
         in the ocean. Since it’s hard to transmit signals through a
         dolphin, the transmitter should store the temperature data
         until it is excreted by the dolphin and floats to the surface
         where your receiver can detect the signal.</p>
         <p>These and many other applications require complex digital
         circuitry. Any digital system, including a programmable
         computer, can be built by combining the gates and flip-flops we
         discussed in the previous experiment. But it is hardly
         practical to build something like a computer by connecting a
         bunch of TTL chips, since you could easily require thousands or
         even millions of gates. There are much better ways to get the
         job done. In fact, if you find yourself using more than a few
         discrete logic gates in a circuit you are probably using the
         wrong tools.</p>
         <h1 data-number="4"
         id="filed-programmable-gate-arrays-and-microcontrollers"><span
         class="header-section-number">4</span> Filed Programmable Gate
         Arrays and Microcontrollers</h1>
         <p>Sometimes it is worth designing an application-specific
         circuit and having it manufactured on a single chip. However,
         this is mainly practical only for large-scale operations and
         not feasible for the specific requirements of a single
         scientific experiment. Instead, scientists make use of Field
         Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). These are chips containing
         many logic gates, and in most cases also flip-flops, which can
         be programmed (sometimes only once, sometimes many times) to
         interconnect the gates and flip-flops in a way that performs a
         custom function (see H&amp;H 8.15, 8.27). A single FPGA can
         replace a large pile of TTL chips, and the smaller FPGAs
         containing a few thousand gates are inexpensive and relatively
         easy to program. The largest FPGAs can contain 300,000 gates or
         more, and the programming effort can become a major
         project.</p>
         <p>But by far the most common approach to complex digital
         design is to use a microcontroller, a single chip programmable
         computer. Compared to most FPGAs, microcontrollers process data
         more slowly but with much greater flexibility and power, and
         they are generally cheaper and more power efficient. They are
         available in incredible variety, from 8-pin versions costing
         less than a dollar to devices with processing power rivaling
         that of a PC.</p>
         <h1 data-number="5" id="arduinos"><span
         class="header-section-number">5</span> Arduinos</h1>
         <p>In this lab, we will take a look at what microcontrollers
         can do by working with the Arduino Uno board. “Arduino”, as
         they say at their <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">website</a>
         “… is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on
         flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It’s intended for
         artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in
         creating interactive objects or environments.” Arduino has been
         highly successful in bringing out simple microcontroller boards
         that can be programmed easily. These boards have a huge
         international following that has resulted in a wide range of
         books, publicly available programs, robotics kits, and the
         like. These resources make the Arduino a common and easy choice
         when thinking about a microcontroller project because it’s very
         likely that someone has already solved your problem and has
         posted the solution code for FREE on the Arduino website (or
         elsewhere on the internet).</p>
         <p>The heart of the Arduino Uno is the 28 pin ATMEL ATmega328P.
         It is a member of the ATMEL 8-bit AVR microcontroller family,
         with 32 kB of 8-bit wide program memory, 1kB of electronically
         erasable and programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and 2 kB
         of 8 bit data memory. Program memory uses ‘flash’ technology,
         so you can program it over and over again as you debug your
         hardware and code, and it is non- volatile, so the chip won’t
         forget its programming when you turn the power off. Programming
         can be done without taking the chip out of its socket on the
         Arduino Uno board via a serial digital USB interface. You
         download a program development environment from the Arduino
         site, plug the Arduino Uno board into a USB port on your
         laptop, and start uploading programs to the Arduino
         microcontroller.</p>
         <p>Nearly every pin of the ATMEL ATmega328P microcontroller
         chip can be programmed in multiple ways for various uses, and
         up to 23 of the 28 pins can be used as bi-directional digital
         I/O. There is an internal, variable frequency clock and three
         separate timer/counter/scalers. For dealing with analog signals
         there is a comparator with a programmable voltage reference, 6
         channels of pulse-width-modulated (PWM) output to simulate
         adjustable external analog voltages, and to top it all off, a
         10-bit analog-to-digital converter with a 6- channel analog
         multiplexer, so you can digitize 6 separate analog signals.
         Amazingly, you can have all this for around $3 per chip.</p>

         <li>Now, further modify your code to make each LED flash in
         sequence. Document your changes in your lab book.</li>
         <li>Include the final version of your sketch in your lab
         notebook.</li>

         Own Project</h1>
         <p>Now that you have a taste of what Arduinos can do, pick a
         simple project and do it! It can be an extension of the
         flashing LEDs you just made, or something completely different.
         Feel free to use any of the components we’ve used in previous
         labs. Document your goals, approach, progress, and results in
         your lab notebook. Remember that the lab notebook should be a
         complete record which someone else could use without difficulty
         to reproduce what you did. If you are having trouble deciding
         on a project, there are some suggestions in the appendix.</p>

         Ideas</h1>
         <ul>
         <li>Adjust your current 10-LED setup so that it counts up in
         binary.</li>
         <li>Use the potentiometer to control the brightness of the LEDs
         using the concept of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). As long as
         the LED is flashing faster than about 60 Hz, it will simply
         appear solid. You can flash with a varying duty cycle to make
         it brighter or dimmer. You can do this yourself or with the
         “analogWrite” function. You could replace the potentiometer
         with the input from the 3.5mm headphone jack plugged into a
         device that is playing music so that the LED brightness depends
         on the volume of the music.</li>
         <li>Connect your speaker to one of the digital outputs. Use the
         “tone” function to play frequencies. You can control the
         frequencies with the potentiometer. Or, you can use the
         photometer circuit from Lab 7 to provide the voltage so that
         the sound frequency is dependent on the light level. Or you can
         use the “random” function to play random frequencies.</li>
         <li>Generate a periodic square wave with the 555 Timer circuit
         from the last lab but configure it to use a potentiometer and a
         resistor to allow for a range of frequencies. You should power
         the 555 Timer with the +5 V from the Arduino. Feed the output
         of the 555 Timer circuit into the Arduino and measure the
         length of time that the pulse is high and low (see the
         “pulseIn” function). From that, calculate the period,
         frequency, and duty cycle. Print out the information and see
         what happens when you vary the potentiometer.</li>
         </ul>
