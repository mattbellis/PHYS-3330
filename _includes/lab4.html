         <p>In this lab, you will characterize the gain and frequency
         dependence of op-amp circuits, one of the most useful
         components in electronics. You will also measure input and
         output impedances of these circuits. The op-amp is the most
         important building block of analog electronics. As op-amps are
         made out of transistors, most textbooks discuss transistors
         first, followed by op-amps. We choose the opposite order as we
         are not particularly interested in how op-amps are constructed
         but rather how to use them in circuits and the principles of
         op-amps operation are actually simpler than for
         transistors.</p>

         OP-Amps</h1>
         <p>One of the main purposes of an amplifier is to increase the
         voltage level of a signal while preserving as accurately as
         possible the original waveform. In the physical sciences,
         transducers are used to convert basic physical quantities into
         electric signals, as shown in Figure <a
         href="#fig:lab-measurement">1</a>. An amplifier is usually
         needed to raise the small transducer voltage (<span
         class="math inline">\(\mu V\)</span> to <span
         class="math inline">\(mV\)</span>) to a useful level (<span
         class="math inline">\(mV\)</span> to <span
         class="math inline">\(V\)</span>).</p>
         <div id="fig:lab-measurement" class="fignos">
         <figure>
         <img src="../resources/lab4fig/lab-measurement.png"
         alt="Figure 1: Typical laboratory measurement system" />
         <figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span>Figure 1:</span> Typical
         laboratory measurement system</figcaption>
         </figure>
         </div>
         <p>Measuring and recording equipment typically requires input
         signals of <span class="math inline">\(10~ mV\)</span> to <span
         class="math inline">\(10~ V\)</span>. To meet such needs, a
         typical laboratory amplifier might have the following
         characteristics:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Predictable and stable gain. The magnitude of the gain
         is equal to the ratio of the output signal amplitude to the
         input signal amplitude.</p></li>
         <li><p>Linear amplitude response, so that the output signal is
         directly proportional to the input signal.</p></li>
         <li><p>According to the application, the frequency dependence
         of the gain might be a constant independent of frequency up to
         the highest frequency component in the input signal (wideband
         amplifier), or a sharply tuned resonance response if a
         particular frequency must be picked out.</p></li>
         <li><p>High input impedance and low output impedance are
         usually desirable. These characteristics minimize changes of
         gain when the amplifier is connected to the input transducer
         and to other instruments at the output.</p></li>
         <li><p>Low noise is usually important. Every amplifier adds
         some random noise to the signals it processes, and this noise
         often limits the sensitivity of an experiment.</p></li>
         </ol>
         <p>Commercial laboratory amplifiers are readily available, but
         a general-purpose amplifier is expensive (&gt;$1000), and most
         of its features might be unneeded in a given application.
         Often, it is preferable to design your own circuit using a
         cheap (&lt;$1) op-amp chip. Op-amps have many other circuit
         applications. They can be used to make comparators, filters,
         limiters, rectifiers, oscillators, integrators, and other
         devices. We will build some of these circuits in later
         labs.</p>
         <h1 data-number="4" id="op-amp-basics"><span
         class="header-section-number">4</span> OP-Amp Basics</h1>
         <p>Two basic op-amp circuit configurations, the non-inverting
         amplifier and the inverting amplifier, are shown in Figures <a
         href="#fig:non-invert">2</a> and <a href="#fig:invert">3</a>,
         respectively. Both circuits use <strong><em>negative
         feedback</em></strong>, which means that a portion of the
         output signal is sent back to the negative input of the op-amp
         through the feedback resistor <span
         class="math inline">\(R_F\)</span>. The op-amp itself has very
         high gain, but relatively poor gain stability and linearity.
         When negative feedback is used, the circuit gain is greatly
         reduced, but it becomes very stable. Also, linearity is
         improved, and the output impedance decreases.</p>

         <p>Both configurations are widely used because they have
         different advantages. Besides the fact that the second circuit
         inverts the signal, the main differences are that the first
         circuit has much higher input impedance, while the second has
         lower distortion because both inputs remain very close to
         ground. In this lab, we will be focusing on the first-type,
         non-inverting.</p>
         <p>The gain or transfer function, <span
         class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, of the <strong>op-amp
         alone</strong> is given by</p>
         <p><span
         class="math display">\[A\equiv\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}^+-V_{in}^-}\]</span></p>
         <p>where the denominator is the difference between the voltages
         applied to the + and - inputs. We use the symbol <span
         class="math inline">\(G\)</span> for the gain of the complete
         amplifier with feedback: <span class="math inline">\(G =
         V_{out}/V_{in}\)</span>. This gain depends on the resistor
         divider ratio</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[B = \frac{R}{R +
         R_{F}}\]</span></p>
         <p>If we assume an ideal situation where <span
         class="math inline">\(A = \infty\)</span>, that the op-amp
         input impedance is infinite, and that the output impedance is
         zero, then the behavior of these circuits can be understood
         using the simple "Golden Rules":</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p><strong>The voltage difference between the inputs is
         zero. ("voltage rule")</strong></p></li>
         <li><p><strong>No current flows into (or out of) each input.
         ("current rule")</strong></p></li>
         </ol>
         <p>The “Golden Rule” analysis is very important and is always
         the first step is designing op-amp circuits, so be sure you
         understand it before you read the material below, where we
         consider the effect of finite values of <span
         class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
         <h2 data-number="4.1" id="non-inverting-amplifier"><span
         class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Non-inverting
         amplifier</h2>
         <p>The basic formula for the low frequency gain of
         non-inverting amplifiers is derived in Steck Section 7.3.3.
         Using just the Golden rules, which assumes <span
         class="math inline">\(A\gg 1\)</span>, the gain is given by</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[G_{0} = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}
         =\frac{R+R_F}{R} = 1 + \frac{R_{F}}{R}\]</span></p>
         <p>Equations for the input and output impedance of the entire
         circuit are derived in H&amp;H Section 4.26. The results
         are</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[R_{i}^{&#39;} = R_{i}(1 +
         AB)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[R_{o}^{&#39;} =
         R_{o}/(1 + AB)\]</span></p>
         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> and <span
         class="math inline">\(R_o\)</span> are the input and output
         impedances of the <em>op-amp alone</em>, while the primed
         symbols refer to the whole amplifier with feedback. These
         impedances will be improved from the values for the bare op-amp
         if <span class="math inline">\(A\cdot B\)</span> is large.</p>
         <p>The above formulas are still correct when <span
         class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and/or <span
         class="math inline">\(B\)</span> depend on frequency. <span
         class="math inline">\(B\)</span> will be frequency independent
         if we have a resistive feedback network (in other cases that
         use complex impedance it may not be), but <span
         class="math inline">\(A\)</span> always varies with frequency.
         For most op-amps, including the LF356, the open loop gain
         varies with frequency like an RC low-pass filter:</p>
         <p><span
         class="math display">\[A(f)=\frac{A_0}{1+j\frac{f}{f_0}}\]</span></p>
         <p>The 3dB frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>,
         is usually very low, around 10 Hz. Data sheets do not usually
         give <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> directly; instead
         they give the DC gain, <span
         class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, and the unity gain
         frequency <span class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span>, which is
         the frequency where the magnitude of the open loop gain A is
         equal to one. The relation between <span
         class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, <span
         class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>, and <span
         class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span> is</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[f_{T} = A_{0}f_{0}\]</span></p>
         <p>The frequency dependence of the closed loop gain <span
         class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is then given by:</p>
         <p><span
         class="math display">\[G(f)=\frac{G_0}{1+j\frac{f}{f_B}}\]</span></p>
         <p>The frequency response of the amplifier with feedback is
         therefore also the same as for an RC low-pass filter.</p>
         <p>We can now derive an example of a very important general
         rule connecting the gain and bandwidth of feedback amplifiers.
         Multiplying the low frequency gain <span
         class="math inline">\(G_0\)</span> by the 3 dB bandwidth <span
         class="math inline">\(f_B\)</span> gives</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[A_0 f_0=G_0 f_B =
         f_T\]</span></p>
         <p>In words, this very important formula says that the
         gain-bandwidth product, <span
         class="math inline">\(G_0f_B\)</span>, equals the unity gain
         frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span>. Thus if an
         op-amp has a unity gain frequency, <span
         class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span>, of 1 MHz, it can be used to
         make a non-inverting amplifier with a gain of one and a
         bandwidth of 1 MHz, or with a gain of 10 and a bandwidth of 100
         kHz, <em>etc.</em> We will consider what this means for the
         transfer function as a function of frequency on a Bode
         plot.</p>

         <li><p>This experiment will use both +15 V and –15 V to power
         the LF356 op-amp. <span style="color: red;">Make sure you
         <strong>unplug</strong> the DC supplies while wiring your
         op-amp (you may find it useful to plug them into their own
         power strip). Everyone makes mistakes in wiring-up circuits.
         You should always check your circuit over before applying
         power.</span> Figure <a href="#fig:lf356">4</a> shows a pin-out
         for the LF356 chip. Familiarize yourself with the layout. The
         following procedure will help you wire up a circuit
         accurately:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Draw a complete schematic in your lab notebook,
         including all ground and power connections, and all IC pin
         numbers. Try to layout your prototype so the parts are arranged
         in the same way as on the schematic, as far as
         possible.</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure all resistor values before putting them in the
         circuit. Make sure you are using the correct capacitors. Some
         capacitors indicate the capacitance directly, but small
         capacitors usually just have a number where 10 = 10 pF, 102 =
         10x10<sup>2</sup> pF = 1 nF, 103 = 10x10<sup>3</sup> = 10 nF,
         104 = 10x10<sup>4</sup> pF = 100 nF. Also, see the important
         note below about polarized capacitors.</p></li>
         <li><p>Adhere to a color code for wires. For example:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p><span style="color: black;">0V (ground)
         Black</span></p></li>
         <li><p><span style="color: red;">+15V Red</span></p></li>
         <li><p><span style="color: blue;">-15V Blue</span></p></li>
         </ul></li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>The op-amp chip sits across a groove in the prototyping
         board (see Figure <a href="#fig:pb">5</a>). Before inserting a
         chip, ensure the pins are straight (using a needle-nose pliers
         or something similar). After insertion, check visually that no
         pin is broken or bent under the chip. To remove the chip, use a
         small screwdriver in the groove to pry it out.</p></li>
         <li><p>You will have less trouble with spontaneous oscillations
         if the circuit layout is neat and compact, in particular the
         feedback path should be as short as possible to reduce unwanted
         capacitive coupling (see Figure <a href="#fig:pb">5</a>). Also,
         wire around the chip rather than over it.</p></li>
         <li><p>To help prevent spontaneous oscillations due to
         unintended coupling via the power supplies, use bypass
         capacitors to filter the power supply lines. A bypass capacitor
         between each power supply lead and ground will provide a
         miniature current “reservoir” that can quickly supply current
         when needed. This capacitor is normally in the range 1-10 µF.
         <span style="color: red;">Compact capacitors in this range are
         usually <strong><em>polarized</em></strong>, meaning that one
         terminal must always be positive relative to the other. If you
         put a polarized capacitor in backwards, it will burn
         out.</span> You will probably hear a pop and smell something
         foul. Please don’t do this. The negative side should have an
         arrow on the capacitor. Also, the positive side should have a
         longer lead but this is not a good identification method as the
         leads can (and should) be cut. Bypass capacitors should be
         placed close to the op-amp pins. If you are connecting the +15
         V supply to ground, the negative capacitor lead is connected to
         ground and the positive lead is connected to +15 V. If you are
         connecting the -15 V supply to ground, the negative capacitor
         lead is connected to -15 V and the positive lead is connected
         to ground.</p></li>

         <li><p>You can save yourself some frustration by testing your
         op-amp chips to make sure they are not burned out. Connect the
         op-amp as a grounded-input <strong><em>voltage
         follower</em></strong> with the (positive) input grounded (see
         Figure <a href="#fig:voltage-follower-gnd">6</a>). What is the
         predicted voltage on pins 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 using the Golden
         Rule model? Measure and record the measured voltages on these
         pins. If your predictions do not match your measurements check
         your connections to the chip to find the problem. Make sure
         your predictions match your measurements before going on. It
         will be helpful to leave the voltage follower built on your
         board to quickly check an op-amp in future weeks. Move the chip
         out and build the other circuits elsewhere on your
         protoboard.</p></li>
         <li><p>If you find you have a bad chip, throw it in the trash

         <p>A voltage follower is the simplest version of a

         gain (G<sub>0</sub>=1), but it lets you convert a signal with
         high impedance (i.e. very little current) to a much lower
         impedance output for driving loads. The voltage follower is

         <li><p>The voltage follower circuit is nearly the same as the
         test circuit, except that now a signal enters the positive
         input (Figure <a href="#fig:voltage-follower">7</a>). The basic
         test and measurement setup is shown in Figure <a
         href="#fig:op-amp-test">8</a>.</p></li>
         <li><p>Use the function generator to measure the low frequency
         gain. What frequency should you use to test the low frequency
         gain (i.e., what frequency should the signal be below)?
         Consider the gain-bandwidth product for a unity gain amplifier.
         What is the gain-bandwidth product for this circuit? How did
         you find the value? What is the predicted gain for the
         frequency you chose? Measure the low frequency gain <span

         class="math inline">\(V_{in}\)</span> and <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{out}\)</span> using the scope. Do your
         measurements agree with your predictions?</p></li>
         <li><p>Now vary the frequency and look for deviation from the
         performance of an ideal follower model. The measurement at high
         frequency will depend on many details of your setup and you are
         unlikely to find a simple RC filter type falloff. Using the 10X
         scope-probe, measure the gain at every decade in frequency from
         10 MHz down to 10 Hz, with (as usual) a few extra points
         anywhere things are starting to change. Do you find any
         deviation from unity gain? HINT: Be sure that the output
         amplitude is below the level affected by the slew rate For
         help, see H&amp;H p. 192. Plot the low and high frequency data
         and predicted behavior on your Bode plot from your lab prep. Do
         you find a simple fall-off as suggested by the theory for the
         ideal follower (<span class="math inline">\(f_T=f_B\)</span>)?
         If so, find the 3 dB frequency. How does your measured 3 dB
         frequency compare to what is expected from the op-amp
         datasheet?</p></li>
         <li><p>If you observed ideal behavior, youre lucky! At
         frequencies above a few MHz, the simple model of the frequency
         response of the op-amp is not accurate. Once you are in this
         frequency range, many physical details of your circuit and
         breadboard can have large effects in the circuit (see notes in
         7.1.4 above). You could model these effects, but a better
         procedure to follow is to modify the physical setup. Building
         reliable circuits at these frequencies typically requires
         careful attention to grounding and minimization of capacitive
         and inductive coupling between circuit elements and to ground.
         Printed circuit boards are much better for high-frequency
         applications. At lower frequencies, our model of the circuit
         will work much better.</p></li>

         agree with the one from the datasheet?</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure the frequency dependence of your circuit.
         Measure the gain at every decade in frequency from 1 MHz down
         to 10 Hz. You should record <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{out}\)</span> and <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{in}\)</span> as well as the calculated
         gain. Plot your gain measurements and predicted gain curve on
         the same plot. Where, if at all, is the simple model of the
         op-amp circuit not valid? Suggest possible model refinements
         and/or physical system refinements to get better agreement
         between the model predictions and measurements.</p></li>

         input impedance of the op-amp alone in your prelab.) Explain
         how you determined this number. If you were to increase the
         input impedance by placing a 1 M<span
         class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> resistor in series with
         the input, predict how much the output voltage will change.
         Hint: consider the voltage drop across the 1 M<span
         class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> resistor to get the
         voltage at Pin 3. Measure <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{out}\)</span> with and without the 1
         M<span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> resistor in place.
         It is better not to measure <span

         class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>. (Model as a voltage
         divider with the op-amp output impedance as one resistor and
         your load resistor as the other resistor.) Measure the output
         voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_{out}\)</span> for all
         three configurations (no load, 200 <span

         values agree with your model prediction? If not, can you make
         modifications to your model to understand the discrepancy?
