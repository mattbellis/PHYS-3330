         <p>Today you will learn to use equipment that are useful for
         building and testing electronic circuits. You will use all of
         these instruments extensively throughout the semester.</p>
         <ul>
         <li>Power supply
         <ul>
         <li>This is used to provide DC power to your circuits</li>
         <li>It can be used as a voltage source (constant voltage) or a
         current source (constant current).</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>Function generator
         <ul>
         <li>This is used to create signals with various waveforms</li>
         <li>This is an incredibly useful tool for characterizing the
         frequency dependance of your circuits.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>Digital multimeter (DMM)
         <ul>
         <li>This is an extremely versatile tool that can measure DC and
         AC voltages and currents, resistances, and sometimes more
         (depending on the model)</li>
         <li>It has a simple display that can only show single values
         such as a root-mean-square voltage <em>or</em> the frequency of
         an AC signal.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>Oscilloscope (aka scope)
         <ul>
         <li>This is a voltage meter that can “plot” voltage over
         time</li>
         <li>This is a far more powerful tool for characterizing
         voltages than the DMM because you can characterize wave shapes
         and noise.</li>
         </ul></li>
         </ul>
         <!--
         *** added "further" to imply continuation. some other minor edits 
         -->
         <p>In this course you will continue to develop essential
         laboratory skills. Not only is the above equipment found in
         nearly every lab space, but you will practice keeping a lab
         notebook in a practical way and practice a model based approach
         to experimental design.</p>
         <!-- 
         *** had difficulty parsing the feedback for this part, but I think I improved it
         -->
         <p>In this course, you will practice implementing, testing, and
         refining models. Extremely accurate and nuanced models are
         often difficult to implement, so it can be desirable to adjust
         physical systems to accommodate simpler models. Balancing
         accuracy and simplicity is a skill and takes practice.</p>
         <p>Today, you will</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Connect your circuit to <em>Earth ground</em>,</p></li>
         <li><p>Set up the power supply so that you can get voltages
         both above and below ground (positive and negative
         voltages),</p></li>
         <li><p>Operate the power supply in constant voltage and
         constant current modes,</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure physical properties, such as voltage
         differences, current, and resistance,</p></li>
         <li><p>Trigger the oscilloscope,</p></li>
         <li><p>Operate the function generator,</p></li>

         <!--
         *** added this 
         -->
         <ul>
         <li><p>Use a caliper or micrometer to measure the diameter of a
         wire and estimate the resistance,</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure resistors using 2-terminal and with 4-terminal
         measurement methods,</p></li>
         <li><p>Develop familiarity with the model-based approach to
         experiment.</p></li>

         <h1 data-number="2" id="lab-notebook-guidelines"><span
         class="header-section-number">2</span> Lab Notebook
         Guidelines</h1>
         <p>Lab notebooks are an essential tool in research and
         development settings. They may seem tedious to maintain, but if
         you develop good habits now, you will avoid unnecessary
         headaches in the future. Poor notetaking can cause you to lose
         track of data or the meaning of data which can force you to
         unnecessarily repeat experiments and/or calculations.</p>
         <p>The lab notebook will play an essential role in this course
         and will be graded each week. You will use your notebook for
         keeping records of many things including:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Answering prelab questions from the lab guide to prepare
         you for upcoming lab activities,</p></li>
         <li><p>Answering in-lab questions,</p></li>
         <li><p>Measurements and data,</p></li>
         <li><p>Plots, diagrams, pictures, and sketches,</p></li>
         <li><p>Experimental procedures and designs,</p></li>
         <li><p>Analyses and results.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>The lab notebook will be an important part of your grade
         because learning to keep a good lab notebook is crucial for
         your professional development. Keeping a physical notebook is
         very common, but many people like to keep digital notebooks
         nowadays, usually as a supplement to a physical notebook. There
         are many popular tools; since the University now uses a
         Microsoft ecosystem, OneNote ends up being very convenient for
         integrating with other Microsoft tools such as Teams and
         OneDrive. Jupyter notebooks are another useful tool as they can
         integrate Python code with Markdown (with LaTeX compatibility)
         which can streamline your calculations and allow for nice and
         easy plots. Your lab notebook is the main mechanism for
         communicating your processes and results of the lab
         experiments. Each week, you will be responsible for turning in
         both your pre-lab work and your lab notebook / analyses via
         Canvas. See the syllabus for more information.</p>
         <!--You may find it helpful to write up many of your notes on the computer, for example, within Mathematica, Jupyter Notebooks. This is fine. However, before your notebook is turned in, the notes, plots, and analysis should be transferred to the lab notebook by printing and taping the pages or keeping them in a three-ring binder. This is standard practice in research labs. Your lab notebook is the main mechanism for communicating your process and results of the lab experiments. Each week, you will be responsible for turning in both your pre-laboratory work and your lab notebook / analysis via Canvas in scanned format. See the syllabus for more information.-->

         class="header-section-number">4</span> Some Useful
         Definitions</h1>
         <p><strong>Common ground</strong> - there are many types of
         ground and people often confuse them and use the word “ground”
         to refer to any one of them. A common ground is any part of a
         circuit which is (arbitrarily) referred to as <span
         class="math inline">\(0\text{ V}\)</span> and that all other
         voltages are measured with respect to.</p>
         <p><strong>Earth ground</strong> - a common ground which is
         ultimately connected to the Earth. The 3<sup>rd</sup> prong on
         wall outlets is Earth ground. Under buildings large metal
         plates are buried and are connected to via a <em>ground
         wire</em>. Earth ground allows for certain kinds of short
         circuit failures (and lightning strikes) to have the power
         diverted away and avoid excessive damage to devices, buildings,
         or <strong>YOU</strong>.</p>
         <p><strong>Chassis ground</strong> - a common ground which is a
         metal frame around the circuit. If a device plugs into the wall
         with 3 prongs, it is likely that the chassis is also connected
         to <strong>Earth ground</strong>. Chassis grounding can help
         facilitate the safety of Earth grounding, but also acts a
         Faraday cage, shielding the circuit from external EM waves.</p>
         <p><strong>Electrical load</strong> - a load refers to the
         impedance/resistance (in ohms) connected from the output of a
         power source to the circuit’s ground. This could be a speaker,
         a light bulb, a microwave oven, or anything else which is
         drawing power from the circuit.</p>
         <p><strong>RMS (Root Mean Square)</strong> - the square root of
         the average of a periodic function squared over one period
         <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{RMS}=\sqrt{\langle
         V(t)^{2}\rangle}\)</span>. Example: For the function <span
         class="math inline">\(V(t) = V_0\sin(\omega t)\)</span>, the
         RMS value is <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{RMS} =
         \large\frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}}\)</span>.</p>
         <p><em>Note:</em> <span
         class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\approx
         0.707\)</span>. This number will come up <strong>a lot</strong>
         in this course, and is worth committing to memory!</p>

         # Text Books

         This course does not require purchasing a textbook, but we recommend using an external resource to read as a supplement. Each prelab will point out sections in each of these books that are relevant to the content of the lab that week.

         1.  [Analog and Digital Electronics - D. A. Steck](https://atomoptics-nas.uoregon.edu/~dsteck/teaching/electronics/electronics-notes.pdf)
             - This text is freely available as a PDF, so you may want to download it and keep it handy.

         2.  The Electronics Companion - A. C. Fischer-Cripps
             - This is a great reference for quick information.
             - There is a copy of the first edition in the lab.

         3.  The Art of Electronics - P. Horowitz and W. Hill 
             - This is a very practical (and in depth) textbook
             - This book is an invaluable resource for designing your final projects
             - Very comprehensive discussions of advanced topics, but sparse on the introductory basics.
             - There are 3 copies of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition in the lab.

         For today's lab, the following sections are useful and relevant readings

         class="header-section-number">5</span> Preparing for
         computational work</h1>
         <p>Throughout this course, there will be many calculations that
         you will use repeatedly. It may seem like extra work now, but
         adopting this practice early will help streamline your workflow
         throughout the semester and make your life easier in the long
         run.</p>
         <p>It’s important then to be able to plot data or mathematical
         functions with relative ease. There is an “Assignment”

         <p>In Physics 2, you learned introductory basics to circuits.
         Metals have free electrons that can flow through the material
         (current) when there is a difference in electric potential
         across it (voltage applied). Ohm’s law describes the
         relationship between current and voltage:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\Delta V = IR\]</span></p>
         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is resistance
         with units of <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>

         (Scope)</h2>
         <p><strong>Pre-caveat!</strong> We have a variety of models of
         oscillocopes for use in our labs. Your oscilloscope may not be
         exactly the same model as described below, however, it should
         have the same functionality. That is, it should be able to do
         everything that the described model can: it will have a
         vertical control, a horizontal control, etc. While it seems
         like an excuse (and perhaps it is), it’s a good skill to learn
         how to work with different types of equipment.</p>
         <p>If you absolutely cannot find the same control on your scope
         as described in this text, let your instructor know.</p>
         <p><strong>OK, back to the lab…</strong></p>
         <p>The goal of this part of the lab is to be able to use an
         oscilloscope (aka scope or o-scope) to make voltage
         measurements over time. Old, analog scopes scanned an electron
         beam horizontally across fluorescent screen, and applying a
         voltage at the input would cause the beam to deflect up and
         down with the voltage, allowing you to visualize how the
         voltage behaved over time. Today, most labs are equipped with
         digital oscilloscopes which rapidly measure the voltage and
         then plot the data on a screen in real time. This has many
         advantages over using the DMM as a voltmeter because it gives
         you much more information about the voltage you’re
         measuring.</p>
         <p>There are a few precautions to observe when operating the
         oscilloscope:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Avoid overheating the instrument. Do not block
         ventilation of the interior.</p></li>
         <li><p>Do not apply more than 300 V to any input
         terminal.</p></li>
         <li><p>Avoid serious or fatal injury from electrical shock. Do
         not remove the case to expose the 120 V mains.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>Otherwise, the instruments are robust and cannot be damaged
         by wrong settings. So, try whatever you’re curious about and
         measure and document what happens.</p>

         <p><span style="color: red;">There is one main
         <strong>precaution</strong> to keep in mind: <strong><em>Do not
         connect any output of the function generator directly to DC
         power</em></strong> or to the output of any other instrument or
         circuit. Doing so will burn out the output amplifier!</span> In

         a <span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span> load. This
         means that half of the voltage will drop across the output
         impedance, and half will drop across the load, so by default,
         the function generator displays only half the voltage that it
         is actually trying to apply (because this is how much “reaches”
         the load). <span style="color: red;"><strong>Every time you
         turn on the function generator, you have to set the output

         <p>In order to view waves on the oscilloscope, it needs to
         redraw the wave in the right place at the right time.
         “Triggering” is the process of stabilizing a repeating signal
         on the screen.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Use a BNC connector to connect the output of the
         function generator to the input of channel 1 on the
         scope.</p></li>
         <li><p>Set the <em>voltage / div</em> and <em>time / div</em>
         so that the sine wave appears nice and big on the screen.
         Remember that the period is the inverse of the frequency.
         Always consider the frequency you are using and adjust the
         scope’s horizontal scale appropriately to avoid aliasing! Talk
         with an instructor to learn more about aliasing.</p></li>
         <li><p>The <strong>Trigger</strong> options are in the
         top-right corner of the oscilloscope’s front panel. Open the
         <em>Trigger Menu</em>. You should see that the Channel the
         scope is triggering on is Channel 1.</p></li>
         <li><p>There are 3 options that you will change most regularly.
         Paraphrase these in your lab notebook for future reference.</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p><strong>Trigger channel:</strong> the input that the
         scope uses to trigger (this setting can be changed by pressing
         the vertical-scale knob corresponding to the channel you want
         to trigger to).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Trigger level:</strong> the scope knows to
         trigger the wave when the voltage changes through the trigger
         level voltage (this setting can be changed with the
         <em>Level</em> knob below the <em>Trigger Menu</em>
         button).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Slope:</strong> selects whether to trigger when
         the voltage rises to the trigger level (rising edge), or falls
         to the trigger level (falling edge).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Trigger mode:</strong> of the modes, there are 2
         you will mostly use for this class:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p><strong>Auto (untriggered roll)</strong>: This setting
         is needed to measure DC voltages that don’t pass through a
         trigger level. It does a poor job of triggering on slower waves
         (less than a few hundred <span
         class="math inline">\(\text{Hz}\)</span>).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Normal:</strong> If no trigger event occurs,
         nothing will be displayed (so measuring DC can’t be done). But
         this setting allows you to trigger on slower waves.</p></li>
         </ol></li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><p>Change the trigger channel. Since there is nothing to
         trigger on on other channels, you will see that the wave no
         longer displays in a measurable way (this is what “untriggered”
         looks like). Describe what you see. Change the trigger channel
         back to Channel 1.</p></li>
         <li><p>Play with the trigger level. Describe what you see. Why
         does the wave move? Get help if you don’t understand.</p></li>
         <li><p>Press the slope button to change between rising and
         falling edge triggering. Describe what happens (<em>Hint:</em>
         the wave is <strong>not</strong> “flipping”).</p></li>
         <li><p>Set the trigger level to <span
         class="math inline">\(-400\text{ mV}\)</span>. Is the wave
         still triggered? If not, increase the trigger level a small
         amount until it is.</p></li>
         <li><p>On the function generator, change the amplitude to <span
         class="math inline">\(100\text{ mV}_\text{pp}\)</span>. The
         waveform should no longer be triggered. Why?</p></li>
         </ol>
         <!--
         10. It is annoying to have to adjust the trigger every time you adjust your waveform. To accommodate this, the function generator has an output specifically for triggering on: **Sync / Trigger out** (just to the left of the Channel 1 output).

             - Use a coax cable to connect this output to Channel 4 of the scope.

             - Turn on Channel 4 on the scope.
             
             - Adjust the vertical scale to fully view the waveform. A good habit is to have the wave occupy roughly 75% of the screen vertically.

             - Describe the waveshape.

         11. Change the trigger channel to Channel 4. Adjust the trigger level. Does the trigger level matter? Why?

         12. Play with the waveform (from channel 1) on the function generator. What happens to the **Sync / Trigger out** when you change the

             - the amplitude,

             - the frequency,
             
             - the DC offset,

             - the phase offset,

             - the wave shape?

         14. Why is the **Sync / Trigger out** a square wave?
