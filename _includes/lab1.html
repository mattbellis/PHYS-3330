         <p>Today you will learn to use equipment that are useful for building and testing electronic circuits. You will use all of these instruments extensively throughout the semester.</p>
         <ul>
         <li>Power supply
         <ul>
         <li>This is used to provide DC power to your circuits</li>
         <li>It can be used as a voltage source (constant voltage) or a current source (constant current).</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>Function generator
         <ul>
         <li>This is used to create signals with various waveforms</li>
         <li>This is an incredibly useful tool for characterizing the frequency dependance of your circuits.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>Digital multimeter (DMM)
         <ul>
         <li>This is an extremely versatile tool that can measure DC and AC voltages and currents, resistances, and sometimes more (depending on the model)</li>
         <li>It has a simple display that can only show single values such as a root-mean-square voltage <em>or</em> the frequency of an AC signal.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>Oscilloscope (aka scope)
         <ul>
         <li>This is a voltage meter that can “plot” voltage over time</li>
         <li>This is a far more powerful tool for characterizing voltages than the DMM because you can characterize wave shapes and noise.</li>
         </ul></li>
         </ul>
         <!--
         *** added "further" to imply continuation. some other minor edits 
         -->
         <p>In this course you will continue to develop essential laboratory skills. Not only is the above equipment found in nearly every lab space, but you will practice keeping a lab notebook in a practical way and practice a model based approach to experimental design.</p>
         <!-- 
         *** had difficulty parsing the feedback for this part, but I think I improved it
         -->
         <p>In this course, you will practice implementing, testing, and refining models. Extremely accurate and nuanced models are often difficult to implement, so it can be desirable to adjust physical systems to accommodate simpler models. Balancing accuracy and simplicity is a skill and takes practice.</p>
         <p>Today, you will</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Connect your circuit to <em>Earth ground</em>,</p></li>
         <li><p>Set up the power supply so that you can get voltages both above and below ground (positive and negative voltages),</p></li>
         <li><p>Operate the power supply in constant voltage and constant current modes,</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure physical properties, such as voltage differences, current, and resistance,</p></li>
         <li><p>Trigger the oscilloscope,</p></li>
         <li><p>Operate the function generator,</p></li>
         </ul>
         <!--
         *** added this 
         -->
         <ul>
         <li><p>Use a caliper or micrometer to measure the diameter of a wire and estimate the resistance,</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure resistors using 2-terminal and with 4-terminal measurement methods,</p></li>
         <li><p>Develop familiarity with the model-based approach to experiment.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <h1 data-number="2" id="lab-notebook-guidelines"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Lab Notebook Guidelines</h1>
         <p>Lab notebooks are an essential tool in research and development settings. They may seem tedious to maintain, but if you develop good habits now, you will avoid unnecessary headaches in the future. Poor notetaking can cause you to lose track of data or the meaning of data which can force you to unnecessarily repeat experiments and/or calculations.</p>
         <p>The lab notebook will play an essential role in this course and will be graded each week. You will use your notebook for keeping records of many things including:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Answering prelab questions from the lab guide to prepare you for upcoming lab activities,</p></li>
         <li><p>Answering in-lab questions,</p></li>
         <li><p>Measurements and data,</p></li>
         <li><p>Plots, diagrams, pictures, and sketches,</p></li>
         <li><p>Experimental procedures and designs,</p></li>
         <li><p>Analyses and results.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>The lab notebook will be an important part of your grade because learning to keep a good lab notebook is crucial for your professional development. Keeping a physical notebook is very common, but many people like to keep digital notebooks nowadays, usually as a supplement to a physical notebook. There are many popular tools; since the University now uses a Microsoft ecosystem, OneNote ends up being very convenient for integrating with other Microsoft tools such as Teams and OneDrive. Jupyter notebooks are another useful tool as they can integrate Python code with Markdown (with LaTeX compatibility) which can streamline your calculations and allow for nice and easy plots. Your lab notebook is the main mechanism for communicating your processes and results of the lab experiments. Each week, you will be responsible for turning in both your pre-lab work and your lab notebook / analyses via Canvas. See the syllabus for more information.</p>
         <!--You may find it helpful to write up many of your notes on the computer, for example, within Mathematica, Jupyter Notebooks. This is fine. However, before your notebook is turned in, the notes, plots, and analysis should be transferred to the lab notebook by printing and taping the pages or keeping them in a three-ring binder. This is standard practice in research labs. Your lab notebook is the main mechanism for communicating your process and results of the lab experiments. Each week, you will be responsible for turning in both your pre-laboratory work and your lab notebook / analysis via Canvas in scanned format. See the syllabus for more information.-->
         <h1 data-number="3" id="cables-and-adapters"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Cables and Adapters</h1>
         <p>There are many kinds of cables and adapters found in the lab. The following are some of the more common ones you will encounter.</p>
         <div id="fig:banana" class="fignos">

         <img src="../resources/lab1fig/coax.png" style="width:10cm" alt="" /><figcaption><span>Figure 2:</span> <strong>Coaxial (coax) cables</strong> - this kind of cable is specially designed for sending signals through. It has two conductors: one is the inner conductor which is used to send the signal through, and the other is the outer conductor which is designed to be grounded. Gauss’s law suggests this geometry will shield the inner conductor from external EM fields.</figcaption>
         </figure>
         </div>

         </div>
         <h1 data-number="4" id="some-useful-definitions"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Some Useful Definitions</h1>
         <p><strong>Common ground</strong> - there are many types of ground and people often confuse them and use the word “ground” to refer to any one of them. A common ground is any part of a circuit which is (arbitrarily) referred to as <span class="math inline">\(0\text{ V}\)</span> and that all other voltages are measured with respect to.</p>
         <p><strong>Earth ground</strong> - a common ground which is ultimately connected to the Earth. The 3<sup>rd</sup> prong on wall outlets is Earth ground. Under buildings large metal plates are buried and are connected to via a <em>ground wire</em>. Earth ground allows for certain kinds of short circuit failures (and lightning strikes) to have the power diverted away and avoid excessive damage to devices, buildings, or <strong>YOU</strong>.</p>
         <p><strong>Chassis ground</strong> - a common ground which is a metal frame around the circuit. If a device plugs into the wall with 3 prongs, it is likely that the chassis is also connected to <strong>Earth ground</strong>. Chassis grounding can help facilitate the safety of Earth grounding, but also acts a Faraday cage, shielding the circuit from external EM waves.</p>
         <p><strong>Electrical load</strong> - a load refers to the impedance/resistance (in ohms) connected from the output of a power source to the circuit’s ground. This could be a speaker, a light bulb, a microwave oven, or anything else which is drawing power from the circuit.</p>
         <p><strong>RMS (Root Mean Square)</strong> - the square root of the average of a periodic function squared over one period <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{RMS}=\sqrt{\langle V(t)^{2}\rangle}\)</span>. Example: For the function <span class="math inline">\(V(t) = V_0\sin(\omega t)\)</span>, the RMS value is <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{RMS} = \large\frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}}\)</span>.</p>
         <p><em>Note:</em> <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\approx 0.707\)</span>. This number will come up <strong>a lot</strong> in this course, and is worth committing to memory!</p>
         <h1 data-number="5" id="text-books"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Text Books</h1>
         <p>This course does not require purchasing a textbook, but we recommend using an external resource to read as a supplement. Each prelab will point out sections in each of these books that are relevant to the content of the lab that week.</p>

         <h1 data-number="6" id="prelab"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Prelab</h1>
         <p>Answer the following questions in your lab notebook and with Jupyter Notebooks. Scan the relevant pages and upload the PDF file to Canvas. Note that the lab prep activities are directly related to the lab and by completing them (and having them available during lab) you will be able to work through the lab more efficiently and be able to understand what you are doing during the lab.</p>
         <p>For your calculations, you should write a reusable function in a Python script that you can import into your Jupyter Notebooks. This will allow you to easily update calculations and recycle code in a practical way.</p>
         <p>For example, with a script called <code>jlab.py</code></p>
         <pre><code>
         &quot;&quot;&quot;
         Python script to import useful functions for J-Lab
         &quot;&quot;&quot;

         def parallel_resistance(resistors: list) -&gt; float:
             &quot;&quot;&quot;
             Calculate the parallel resistance of a list of resistor values
             Conductance is 1/Resistance
             returns sum(R_i^(-1))^(-1)
             &quot;&quot;&quot;
             conductance = 0.0  # initialize result of sum
             for resistance in resistors:
                 conductance += 1.0 / resistance  # add each term to sum
             return 1.0 / conductance
         </code></pre>
         <p>This function can be used in a Jupyter Notebook like this</p>
         <pre><code>
         import jlab as jl

         r1 = 2e3  # 2 kOhm
         r2 = 500  # 500 Ohm
         r3 = 1e3  # 1 kOhm
         rp = jl.parallel_restance( [r1, r2, r3] )
         print( &quot;R_p = {:.1f} Ohm&quot;.format(rp) )
         </code></pre>
         <p>Throughout this course, there will be many calculations that you will use repeatedly. It may seem like extra work now, but adopting this practice early will help streamline your workflow throughout the semester and make your life easier in the long run.</p>

         <p>In Physics 2, you learned introductory basics to circuits. Metals have free electrons that can flow through the material (current) when there is a difference in electric potential across it (voltage applied). Ohm’s law describes the relationship between current and voltage:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\Delta V = IR\]</span></p>
         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is resistance with units of <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> (Ohm’s). The resistance of a uniform piece of metal can be described by</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[R = \rho\frac{\ell}{A}\]</span></p>
         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is resistivity (a property that depends on the type of metal), <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> is the length of the metal in the direction the voltage is applied, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the cross-sectional area in the other two directions.</p>

         <p>We want two of the power supply channels to be set up such that the potential difference (voltage) set on one of the channels is <strong><em><span style="color: red;">positive</span></em></strong> <strong>with respect to ground</strong> and the other is <strong><em><span style="color: blue;">negative</span></em></strong> <strong>with respect to ground</strong>.</p>
         <p>By default, all 3 outputs are <strong><em>FLOATING</em></strong> with respect to ground. You have to manually connect one of the terminals of an output to ground in order to “tie” it to ground. This gives you the flexibility to use the power supply in a number of different ways.</p>

         *** I hadn't considered this in detail, but now that you mention it: for single phase AC, hot is black, neutral is white, and ground is green. For DC red is positive, and black is negative: which I believe implies just 2 voltages. Since we use 3 voltages DC, I think the best way to comply with other standards would be for

         Green - Ground

         White - Neutral

         Red - DC above ground

         Black - DC below ground

         *** This way, Red and Black which are both considered "HOT" in some standard, are both considered "hot", and green is considered "cold".

         *** The distinction between neutral and ground being that, even though they are the same voltage, the ground wire is not connected to a load. In this way, making green connections from the ground port to the + and - ports of the outputs and a white wire from the power supply to the bread board would probably be the most "compliant" with safety standards. 

         [//]: # (We harp on that black is ground in this course - I'm not certain why that was historically done here and I'm certainly on board to converting to conventional standards (including shifting red to white and blue to black {I might have that backwords}). But, we should change all the proto board connections to be consistent? Buy a bunch of green banana cables? I'm genuinely in favor of this and it will require revisions to subsequent lab guides.)

         <p><strong>Ohm’s Law</strong> states the voltage drop across a load is</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\Delta V = IR\]</span></p>
         <p>But as the load <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> changes, either the voltage or the current will have to adjust. A <em>voltage source</em> supplies a <em>constant voltage</em> (the current changes), and a <em>current source</em> supplies a <em>constant current</em> (the voltage changes). Mathematically:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Voltage source: <span class="math inline">\(I(R) = \frac{V}{R}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is a constant.</p></li>
         <li><p>Current source: <span class="math inline">\(V(R) = IR\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is a constant.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>The power supply can be used either as a voltage or current source. When it is a voltage source, it will display <strong>CV</strong> for <em>constant voltage</em> in the top right corner of the channel’s display, and when it is a current source, it will display <strong>CC</strong> for <em>constant current</em>. The power supply will automatically switch between these modes depending on the voltage and current limits you set as well as the load attached.</p>

         <li><p>Vary the value of the voltage limit and current limit again. Describe the behavior of the voltage and current readings and the mode (CV/CC) of the power supply. What happens when you short the output to ground (have too small a load)? What is the maximum output of current and voltage your supply can produce?</p></li>
         <li><p>Remove the short.</p></li>
         <li><p>Given a known load of <span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span>, describe how you would set the voltage and current limits to get CV mode with <span class="math inline">\(15\text{ V}\)</span> or CC mode with <span class="math inline">\(300\text{ mA}\)</span> (this is a good place to check in with an instructor).</p></li>
         </ol>
         <p>CV and CC modes are not settings you select in a menu. They are modes inherent to the voltage and current limits set for given ranges of loads.

         <h2 data-number="7.2" id="the-oscilloscope-scope"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> The Oscilloscope (Scope)</h2>
         <p>The goal of this part of the lab is to be able to use an oscilloscope (aka scope or o-scope) to make voltage measurements over time. Old, analog scopes scanned an electron beam horizontally across fluorescent screen, and applying a voltage at the input would cause the beam to deflect up and down with the voltage, allowing you to visualize how the voltage behaved over time. Today, most labs are equipped with digital oscilloscopes which rapidly measure the voltage and then plot the data on a screen in real time. This has many advantages over using the DMM as a voltmeter because it gives you much more information about the voltage you’re measuring.</p>
         <p>There are a few precautions to observe when operating the oscilloscope:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Avoid overheating the instrument. Do not block ventilation of the interior.</p></li>
         <li><p>Do not apply more than 300 V to any input terminal.</p></li>
         <li><p>Avoid serious or fatal injury from electrical shock. Do not remove the case to expose the 120 V mains.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>Otherwise, the instruments are robust and cannot be damaged by wrong settings. So, try whatever you’re curious about and measure and document what happens.</p>

         <p>The Keysight EDU33212A function generator can produce a number of different waveforms over the frequencies from <span class="math inline">\(10^{-6}\text{ Hz}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(20\text{ MHz}\)</span>. The output amplitude can be varied between <span class="math inline">\(1\text{ mV}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(20\text{ V}\)</span> peak-to-peak with an output impedance of <span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span>.</p>
         <p><span style="color: red;">There is one main <strong>precaution</strong> to keep in mind: <strong><em>Do not connect any output of the EDU33212A directly to DC power</em></strong> or to the output of any other instrument or circuit. Doing so will burn out the output amplifier!</span> In a later lab, we’ll learn how to use different tools to allow you to safely interface the function generator with DC power.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>The function generator has an output impedance of <span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span> (there is a <span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span> resistor in series with the output), and it assumes, by default, that you will use a <span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span> load. This means that half of the voltage will drop across the output impedance, and half will drop across the load, so by default, the function generator displays only half the voltage that it is actually trying to apply (because this is how much “reaches” the load). <span style="color: red;"><strong>Every time you turn on the function generator, you have to set the output termination setting to High-Z</strong></span> so that it displays the full voltage (see the appendix or page 53 of the user manual).</p>

         <p>In order to view waves on the oscilloscope, it needs to redraw the wave in the right place at the right time. “Triggering” is the process of stabilizing a repeating signal on the screen.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Use a BNC connector to connect the output of the function generator to the input of channel 1 on the scope.</p></li>
         <li><p>Set the <em>voltage / div</em> and <em>time / div</em> so that the sine wave appears nice and big on the screen. Remember that the period is the inverse of the frequency. Always consider the frequency you are using and adjust the scope’s horizontal scale appropriately to avoid aliasing! Talk with an instructor to learn more about aliasing.</p></li>
         <li><p>The <strong>Trigger</strong> options are in the top-right corner of the oscilloscope’s front panel. Open the <em>Trigger Menu</em>. You should see that the Channel the scope is triggering on is Channel 1.</p></li>
         <li><p>There are 3 options that you will change most regularly. Paraphrase these in your lab notebook for future reference.</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p><strong>Trigger channel:</strong> the input that the scope uses to trigger (this setting can be changed by pressing the vertical-scale knob corresponding to the channel you want to trigger to).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Trigger level:</strong> the scope knows to trigger the wave when the voltage changes through the trigger level voltage (this setting can be changed with the <em>Level</em> knob below the <em>Trigger Menu</em> button).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Slope:</strong> selects whether to trigger when the voltage rises to the trigger level (rising edge), or falls to the trigger level (falling edge).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Trigger mode:</strong> of the modes, there are 2 you will mostly use for this class:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p><strong>Auto (untriggered roll)</strong>: This setting is needed to measure DC voltages that don’t pass through a trigger level. It does a poor job of triggering on slower waves (less than a few hundred <span class="math inline">\(\text{Hz}\)</span>).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Normal:</strong> If no trigger event occurs, nothing will be displayed (so measuring DC can’t be done). But this setting allows you to trigger on slower waves.</p></li>
         </ol></li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><p>Change the trigger channel. Since there is nothing to trigger on on other channels, you will see that the wave no longer displays in a measurable way (this is what “untriggered” looks like). Describe what you see. Change the trigger channel back to Channel 1.</p></li>
         <li><p>Play with the trigger level. Describe what you see. Why does the wave move? Get help if you don’t understand.</p></li>
         <li><p>Press the slope button to change between rising and falling edge triggering. Describe what happens (<em>Hint:</em> the wave is <strong>not</strong> “flipping”).</p></li>
         <li><p>Set the trigger level to <span class="math inline">\(-400\text{ mV}\)</span>. Is the wave still triggered? If not, increase the trigger level a small amount until it is.</p></li>
         <li><p>On the function generator, change the amplitude to <span class="math inline">\(100\text{ mV}_\text{pp}\)</span>. The waveform should no longer be triggered. Why?</p></li>
         <li><p>It is annoying to have to adjust the trigger every time you adjust your waveform. To accommodate this, the function generator has an output specifically for triggering on: <strong>Sync / Trigger out</strong> (just to the left of the Channel 1 output).</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Use a coax cable to connect this output to Channel 4 of the scope.</p></li>
         <li><p>Turn on Channel 4 on the scope.</p></li>
         <li><p>Adjust the vertical scale to fully view the waveform. A good habit is to have the wave occupy roughly 75% of the screen vertically.</p></li>
         <li><p>Describe the waveshape.</p></li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><p>Change the trigger channel to Channel 4. Adjust the trigger level. Does the trigger level matter? Why?</p></li>
         <li><p>Play with the waveform (from channel 1) on the function generator. What happens to the <strong>Sync / Trigger out</strong> when you change the</p>

         [//]: # (maybe combine with next step? This feels offputting - not sure.)

         4.  The DMM also has an AC voltage setting. You will need to use the function generator to produce an AC (sine) waveform. Over what frequency range is the reading accurate to 2%?  Note: the DMM displays the RMS amplitude of the waveform. See Definitions at the beginning of the guide for an explanation of RMS. You will also need to consider how [“Amplitude” and “Peak-to-Peak”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude) are related.

         5.  Remember in the future that this is the usable frequency range for the AC setting of the multimeter. Record this frequency in your lab notebook for future reference.

Magnet wire has a very thin amber-colored insulating coating (about 0.001" in thickness). Make sure you remove the insulation from the ends of the wire to make a good electrical connection and measurement of the diameter of the wire. You can burn off the insulation with a flame or use sand paper to scratch it off.</p></li>

         <p>The way the DMM makes a resistance measurement is by delivering a very small, calibrated, current to the magnet wire, and then it measures the voltage drop across it’s internal resistor (in parallel with your resistor) and calculates <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> based on Ohm’s law. The issue here is that the voltage doesn’t just drop across the resistance of the magnet wire, but also the contacts and all the leads. This is called a 2-terminal measurement because you are using the same 2 terminals to supply the current and measure the voltage. You will now make a more accurate measurement using a 4-terminal measurement.</p>

         <p>You can select various operations to perform on the measurements on various channels. <em>Be very careful</em> with these because they can be very deceptive and may not give the result you are expecting, and how you display the wave on the screen greatly affects the number that “Measure” will report. Generally use cursors to make accurate measurements.</p>
         <p><strong>Cursor Menu (under Navigation):</strong></p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Choose time (vertical bars) or voltage (horizontal bars) measurement.</p></li>
         <li><p>Choose which channel to measure (measurement cursors are the same color as the channel they are measuring). You can change the channel by pressing the numbered channel button.</p></li>
         <li><p>Big top knob moves the cursors. You can press “Fine” to make it move more smoothly (this will also cause other knobs to move more smoothly which can be very annoying).</p></li>
         <li><p>Press the knob like a button to switch cursors.</p></li>
         <li><p>Position relative to ground (trigger zero time) is displayed on the screen with the T symbol.</p></li>
         <li><p>Relative distance between cursors is displayed on the screen with the <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> symbol.</p></li>
