         <p>Today you will learn to use equipment that are useful for
         building and testing electronic circuits. You will use all of
         these instruments extensively throughout the semester.</p>
         <ul>
         <li>Power supply
         <ul>
         <li>This is used to provide DC power to your circuits</li>
         <li>It can be used as a voltage source (constant voltage) or a
         current source (constant current).</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>Function generator
         <ul>
         <li>This is used to create signals with various waveforms</li>
         <li>This is an incredibly useful tool for characterizing the
         frequency dependance of your circuits.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>Digital multimeter (DMM)
         <ul>
         <li>This is an extremely versatile tool that can measure DC and
         AC voltages and currents, resistances, and sometimes more
         (depending on the model)</li>
         <li>It has a simple display that can only show single values
         such as a root-mean-square voltage <em>or</em> the frequency of
         an AC signal.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>Oscilloscope (aka scope)
         <ul>
         <li>This is a voltage meter that can “plot” voltage over
         time</li>
         <li>This is a far more powerful tool for characterizing
         voltages than the DMM because you can characterize wave shapes
         and noise.</li>
         </ul></li>
         </ul>
         <!--
         *** added "further" to imply continuation. some other minor edits 
         -->
         <p>In this course you will continue to develop essential
         laboratory skills. Not only is the above equipment found in
         nearly every lab space, but you will practice keeping a lab
         notebook in a practical way and practice a model based approach
         to experimental design.</p>
         <!-- 
         *** had difficulty parsing the feedback for this part, but I think I improved it
         -->
         <p>In this course, you will practice implementing, testing, and
         refining models. Extremely accurate and nuanced models are
         often difficult to implement, so it can be desirable to adjust
         physical systems to accommodate simpler models. Balancing
         accuracy and simplicity is a skill and takes practice.</p>
         <p>Today, you will</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Connect your circuit to <em>Earth ground</em>,</p></li>
         <li><p>Set up the power supply so that you can get voltages
         both above and below ground (positive and negative
         voltages),</p></li>
         <li><p>Operate the power supply in constant voltage and
         constant current modes,</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure physical properties, such as voltage
         differences, current, and resistance,</p></li>
         <li><p>Trigger the oscilloscope,</p></li>
         <li><p>Operate the function generator,</p></li>
         </ul>
         <!--
         *** added this 
         -->
         <ul>
         <li><p>Use a caliper or micrometer to measure the diameter of a
         wire and estimate the resistance,</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure resistors using 2-terminal and with 4-terminal
         measurement methods,</p></li>
         <li><p>Develop familiarity with the model-based approach to
         experiment.</p></li>

         <h1 data-number="2" id="lab-notebook-guidelines"><span
         class="header-section-number">2</span> Lab Notebook
         Guidelines</h1>
         <p>Lab notebooks are an essential tool in research and
         development settings. They may seem tedious to maintain, but if
         you develop good habits now, you will avoid unnecessary
         headaches in the future. Poor notetaking can cause you to lose
         track of data or the meaning of data which can force you to
         unnecessarily repeat experiments and/or calculations.</p>
         <p>The lab notebook will play an essential role in this course
         and will be graded each week. You will use your notebook for
         keeping records of many things including:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Answering prelab questions from the lab guide to prepare
         you for upcoming lab activities,</p></li>
         <li><p>Answering in-lab questions,</p></li>
         <li><p>Measurements and data,</p></li>
         <li><p>Plots, diagrams, pictures, and sketches,</p></li>
         <li><p>Experimental procedures and designs,</p></li>
         <li><p>Analyses and results.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>The lab notebook will be an important part of your grade
         because learning to keep a good lab notebook is crucial for
         your professional development. Keeping a physical notebook is
         very common, but many people like to keep digital notebooks
         nowadays, usually as a supplement to a physical notebook. There
         are many popular tools; since the University now uses a
         Microsoft ecosystem, OneNote ends up being very convenient for
         integrating with other Microsoft tools such as Teams and
         OneDrive. Jupyter notebooks are another useful tool as they can
         integrate Python code with Markdown (with LaTeX compatibility)
         which can streamline your calculations and allow for nice and
         easy plots. Your lab notebook is the main mechanism for
         communicating your processes and results of the lab
         experiments. Each week, you will be responsible for turning in
         both your pre-lab work and your lab notebook / analyses via
         Canvas. See the syllabus for more information.</p>
         <!--You may find it helpful to write up many of your notes on the computer, for example, within Mathematica, Jupyter Notebooks. This is fine. However, before your notebook is turned in, the notes, plots, and analysis should be transferred to the lab notebook by printing and taping the pages or keeping them in a three-ring binder. This is standard practice in research labs. Your lab notebook is the main mechanism for communicating your process and results of the lab experiments. Each week, you will be responsible for turning in both your pre-laboratory work and your lab notebook / analysis via Canvas in scanned format. See the syllabus for more information.-->

         <h1 data-number="4" id="some-useful-definitions"><span
         class="header-section-number">4</span> Some Useful
         Definitions</h1>
         <p><strong>Common ground</strong> - there are many types of
         ground and people often confuse them and use the word “ground”
         to refer to any one of them. A common ground is any part of a
         circuit which is (arbitrarily) referred to as <span
         class="math inline">\(0\text{ V}\)</span> and that all other
         voltages are measured with respect to.</p>
         <p><strong>Earth ground</strong> - a common ground which is
         ultimately connected to the Earth. The 3<sup>rd</sup> prong on
         wall outlets is Earth ground. Under buildings large metal
         plates are buried and are connected to via a <em>ground
         wire</em>. Earth ground allows for certain kinds of short
         circuit failures (and lightning strikes) to have the power
         diverted away and avoid excessive damage to devices, buildings,
         or <strong>YOU</strong>.</p>
         <p><strong>Chassis ground</strong> - a common ground which is a
         metal frame around the circuit. If a device plugs into the wall
         with 3 prongs, it is likely that the chassis is also connected
         to <strong>Earth ground</strong>. Chassis grounding can help
         facilitate the safety of Earth grounding, but also acts a
         Faraday cage, shielding the circuit from external EM waves.</p>
         <p><strong>Electrical load</strong> - a load refers to the
         impedance/resistance (in ohms) connected from the output of a
         power source to the circuit’s ground. This could be a speaker,
         a light bulb, a microwave oven, or anything else which is
         drawing power from the circuit.</p>
         <p><strong>RMS (Root Mean Square)</strong> - the square root of
         the average of a periodic function squared over one period
         <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{RMS}=\sqrt{\langle
         V(t)^{2}\rangle}\)</span>. Example: For the function <span
         class="math inline">\(V(t) = V_0\sin(\omega t)\)</span>, the
         RMS value is <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{RMS} =
         \large\frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}}\)</span>.</p>
         <p><em>Note:</em> <span
         class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\approx
         0.707\)</span>. This number will come up <strong>a lot</strong>
         in this course, and is worth committing to memory!</p>
         <h1 data-number="5" id="text-books"><span
         class="header-section-number">5</span> Text Books</h1>
         <p>This course does not require purchasing a textbook, but we
         recommend using an external resource to read as a supplement.
         Each prelab will point out sections in each of these books that
         are relevant to the content of the lab that week.</p>

         <p>Answer the following questions in your lab notebook and with
         Jupyter Notebooks. Scan the relevant pages and upload the PDF
         file to Canvas. Note that the lab prep activities are directly
         related to the lab and by completing them (and having them
         available during lab) you will be able to work through the lab
         more efficiently and be able to understand what you are doing
         during the lab.</p>
         <p>For your calculations, you should write a reusable function
         in a Python script that you can import into your Jupyter
         Notebooks. This will allow you to easily update calculations
         and recycle code in a practical way.</p>
         <p>For example, with a script called <code>jlab.py</code></p>
         <pre><code>
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Python script to import useful functions for J-Lab
&quot;&quot;&quot;

def parallel_resistance(resistors: list) -&gt; float:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Calculate the parallel resistance of a list of resistor values
    Conductance is 1/Resistance
    returns sum(R_i^(-1))^(-1)
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    conductance = 0.0  # initialize result of sum
    for resistance in resistors:
        conductance += 1.0 / resistance  # add each term to sum
    return 1.0 / conductance
</code></pre>
         <p>This function can be used in a Jupyter Notebook like
         this</p>
         <pre><code>
import jlab as jl

r1 = 2e3  # 2 kOhm
r2 = 500  # 500 Ohm
r3 = 1e3  # 1 kOhm
rp = jl.parallel_restance( [r1, r2, r3] )
print( &quot;R_p = {:.1f} Ohm&quot;.format(rp) )
</code></pre>
         <p>Throughout this course, there will be many calculations that
         you will use repeatedly. It may seem like extra work now, but
         adopting this practice early will help streamline your workflow
         throughout the semester and make your life easier in the long

         <p>In Physics 2, you learned introductory basics to circuits.
         Metals have free electrons that can flow through the material
         (current) when there is a difference in electric potential
         across it (voltage applied). Ohm’s law describes the
         relationship between current and voltage:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\Delta V = IR\]</span></p>
         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is resistance
         with units of <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>
         (Ohm’s). The resistance of a uniform piece of metal can be
         described by</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[R =
         \rho\frac{\ell}{A}\]</span></p>
         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is
         resistivity (a property that depends on the type of metal),
         <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> is the length of the

         <p>Your DC power supply will provide your circuits with the

         <strong>three</strong> outputs that can be independently

         <p>We want two of the power supply channels to be set up such
         that the potential difference (voltage) set on one of the
         channels is <strong><em><span

         <p>By default, all 3 outputs are
         <strong><em>FLOATING</em></strong> with respect to ground. You
         have to manually connect one of the terminals of an output to
         ground in order to “tie” it to ground. This gives you the

         *** I hadn't considered this in detail, but now that you mention it: for single phase AC, hot is black, neutral is white, and ground is green. For DC red is positive, and black is negative: which I believe implies just 2 voltages. Since we use 3 voltages DC, I think the best way to comply with other standards would be for

         Green - Ground

         White - Neutral

         Red - DC above ground

         Black - DC below ground

         *** This way, Red and Black which are both considered "HOT" in some standard, are both considered "hot", and green is considered "cold".

         *** The distinction between neutral and ground being that, even though they are the same voltage, the ground wire is not connected to a load. In this way, making green connections from the ground port to the + and - ports of the outputs and a white wire from the power supply to the bread board would probably be the most "compliant" with safety standards. 

         [//]: # (We harp on that black is ground in this course - I'm not certain why that was historically done here and I'm certainly on board to converting to conventional standards (including shifting red to white and blue to black {I might have that backwords}). But, we should change all the proto board connections to be consistent? Buy a bunch of green banana cables? I'm genuinely in favor of this and it will require revisions to subsequent lab guides.)

         class="header-section-number">7.2</span> The Oscilloscope
         (Scope)</h2>
         <p>The goal of this part of the lab is to be able to use an
         oscilloscope (aka scope or o-scope) to make voltage
         measurements over time. Old, analog scopes scanned an electron
         beam horizontally across fluorescent screen, and applying a
         voltage at the input would cause the beam to deflect up and
         down with the voltage, allowing you to visualize how the
         voltage behaved over time. Today, most labs are equipped with
         digital oscilloscopes which rapidly measure the voltage and
         then plot the data on a screen in real time. This has many
         advantages over using the DMM as a voltmeter because it gives
         you much more information about the voltage you’re
         measuring.</p>
         <p>There are a few precautions to observe when operating the
         oscilloscope:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Avoid overheating the instrument. Do not block
         ventilation of the interior.</p></li>
         <li><p>Do not apply more than 300 V to any input
         terminal.</p></li>
         <li><p>Avoid serious or fatal injury from electrical shock. Do
         not remove the case to expose the 120 V mains.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>Otherwise, the instruments are robust and cannot be damaged
         by wrong settings. So, try whatever you’re curious about and
         measure and document what happens.</p>

         scope is triggering on is Channel 1.</p></li>
         <li><p>There are 3 options that you will change most regularly.
         Paraphrase these in your lab notebook for future reference.</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p><strong>Trigger channel:</strong> the input that the
         scope uses to trigger (this setting can be changed by pressing
         the vertical-scale knob corresponding to the channel you want
         to trigger to).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Trigger level:</strong> the scope knows to
         trigger the wave when the voltage changes through the trigger
         level voltage (this setting can be changed with the
         <em>Level</em> knob below the <em>Trigger Menu</em>
         button).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Slope:</strong> selects whether to trigger when
         the voltage rises to the trigger level (rising edge), or falls
         to the trigger level (falling edge).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Trigger mode:</strong> of the modes, there are 2
         you will mostly use for this class:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p><strong>Auto (untriggered roll)</strong>: This setting
         is needed to measure DC voltages that don’t pass through a
         trigger level. It does a poor job of triggering on slower waves
         (less than a few hundred <span
         class="math inline">\(\text{Hz}\)</span>).</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Normal:</strong> If no trigger event occurs,
         nothing will be displayed (so measuring DC can’t be done). But
         this setting allows you to trigger on slower waves.</p></li>
         </ol></li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><p>Change the trigger channel. Since there is nothing to
         trigger on on other channels, you will see that the wave no
         longer displays in a measurable way (this is what “untriggered”
         looks like). Describe what you see. Change the trigger channel
         back to Channel 1.</p></li>
         <li><p>Play with the trigger level. Describe what you see. Why
         does the wave move? Get help if you don’t understand.</p></li>
         <li><p>Press the slope button to change between rising and
         falling edge triggering. Describe what happens (<em>Hint:</em>
         the wave is <strong>not</strong> “flipping”).</p></li>
         <li><p>Set the trigger level to <span
         class="math inline">\(-400\text{ mV}\)</span>. Is the wave
         still triggered? If not, increase the trigger level a small
         amount until it is.</p></li>

You will also need to consider how [“Amplitude” and “Peak-to-Peak”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude) are related.

         the entrance of the lab - there should also be a 2m stick near
         the tool cabinet). Magnet wire has a very thin amber-colored
         insulating coating (about 0.001” in thickness). Make sure you
         remove the insulation from the ends of the wire to make a good

         <p>The way the DMM makes a resistance measurement is by
         delivering a very small, calibrated, current to the magnet

         Ohm’s law. The issue here is that the voltage doesn’t just drop
         across the resistance of the magnet wire, but also the contacts
         and all the leads. This is called a 2-terminal measurement
         because you are using the same 2 terminals to supply the
         current and measure the voltage. You will now make a more
         accurate measurement using a 4-terminal measurement.</p>
