         Guidelines</h1>
         <p>The lab notebook will play an essential role in this course.
         You will use your notebook for keeping records of many things
         including:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Answering lab-prep questions from the lab guide</p></li>
         <li><p>Answering in-lab questions</p></li>
         <li><p>Recording data</p></li>
         <li><p>Including plots of data</p></li>
         <li><p>Analysis and results</p></li>
         <li><p>Diagrams and pictures</p></li>
         <li><p>Procedures of experiments that you design</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>The lab notebook will be an important part of your grade
         because learning to keep a good lab notebook is an important
         part of your professional development. You may find it helpful
         to write up many of your notes on the computer, for example,
         within Mathematica or another program. This is fine. However,
         before your notebook is turned in, the notes, plots, and
         analysis should be transferred to the lab notebook by printing
         and taping the pages or keeping them in a three-ring binder.
         This is standard practice in research labs. Your lab notebook
         is the main mechanism for communicating your process and
         results of the lab experiments. Each week, you will be
         responsible for turning in both your pre-laboratory work and
         your lab notebook / analysis via Canvas in scanned format. See
         the syllabus for more information.</p>

         class="header-section-number">5</span> Setting up the DC Power
         Supply</h1>
         <p>Your DC power supply will provide all of your circuits with
         the required power. Setting up the power supply will always be
         the first thing you do when you begin working with a circuit.
         The Keysight EDU36311A DC Power Supply has three outputs that
         can be independently controlled. Pages 43-45 of the User Guide
         (which can be found the <a
         href="/PHYS-3330/manuals-data-sheets">Data Sheets and
         Instrument Manuals page</a>) discuss this in detail.</p>
         <h2 data-number="5.1" id="set-up-the-dc-voltage-bias"><span
         class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Set up the DC voltage
         bias</h2>
         <p>We want two of the power supply channels to be set up such
         that the potential difference set on one of the channels is
         positive with respect to ground and the other is negative with
         respect to ground. Each channel has outputs labeled (+) and (-)
         and you will find that the single output connector to the left
         of Channel 1 is connected to ground. The voltage indicated on
         the power supply display shows only the potential difference
         between the (+) and (-) output for a given channel. You must
         connect a channel’s (-) output to ground to get a positive
         voltage with respect to ground, and a channel’s (+) output to
         ground to get a negative voltage with respect to ground. Since
         Channels 2 and 3 on the Keysight EDU36311A Power Supply have
         the equivalent output voltage and current specifications, it
         makes the most sense to use these two channels.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Get some wire from the wire spool rack on the top of the
         blue tool cabinet to make these connections. You can unscrew
         the input jacks on the power supply to expose a small hole
         where the jumper wires can be inserted (see Figure <a
         href="#fig:ps">1</a>).</li>
         <li>Set up your DMM (found in the grey toolbox in our lab
         bench) to measure a DC voltage. Confirm the sign and magnitude
         of the voltages displayed on the power supply using the DMM
         (you may need to set the voltage limits on the power supply to
         get a non-zero value). In your lab notebook, document the
         setup, the output voltage from the power supply, and the
         measured output on your DMM.</li>

         class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Investigate operating
         modes</h2>
         <p>A voltage source maintains a constant potential difference
         while the current output varies dependent on the load
         resistance (this is the Constant Voltage (CV) mode indicated at
         the top right corner of each channel). A current source
         maintains a constant current while the voltage output varies
         dependent on the load resistance (this is the Constant Current
         (CC) mode). The power supply will indicate the operational mode
         of each channel in the upper right corner of the respective
         channel window (in addition to CV and CC modes, the other mode
         is OFF).</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>With no load attached, record the output voltage and
         current for both power rails (see definitions).</p></li>
         <li><p>Try adjusting the value of the voltage and current. Why
         is the current output always zero?</p></li>
         <li><p>Now short the (+) rail of Channel 2 to ground. You can
         use a banana cable from the rack to do this.</p></li>
         <li><p>Vary the value of the voltage and current. Describe the
         behavior of the voltage and current readings and the mode
         (CV/CC) of the power supply. What happens when you short the
         output to ground (have too small a load)? What is the maximum
         output of current and voltage your supply can produce?</p></li>

         the Oscilloscope</h1>
         <p>The goal of this part of the lab is to be able to use an
         oscilloscope (frequently referred to as scope or o-scope) to
         make measurements of DC voltages and AC waveforms. You will
         also learn how to produce various waveforms using a function
         generator.</p>
         <p>There are a few precautions to observe when operating the
         oscilloscope:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Avoid overheating the instrument. Do not block
         ventilation of the interior.</p></li>
         <li><p>Do not apply more than 300 V to any input
         terminal.</p></li>
         <li><p>Avoid serious or fatal injury from electrical shock. Do
         not remove the cover to expose the 120 V mains.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>Otherwise, the instruments are robust and cannot be damaged
         by wrong settings. So, try whatever you’re curious about and
         measure and document what happens.</p>

         <p>The Tektronix TBS 2000 Series has four independent channels
         so that four separate signals can be displayed at once. Each
         trace is color coded with the buttons on the panel.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Connect a +5V signal from your power supply to the scope
         using the supplied connectors. Measure the voltage on scope
         using the cursors. Try exploring the different knobs and menus
         on the scope to make the measurement. Refer to the appendix
         listed at the end of this document if you get stuck.</p></li>
         <li><p>In your lab notebook, describe the setup of the electric

         <p><em>NOTE: Oscilloscopes can only distinguish about 100
         different values on the vertical axes of the screen. So before
         you use the oscilloscope to measure anything make sure that the
         trace covers at least 50% of the vertical screen without
         clipping at the top or bottom. This way you get a

         waveform on the scope</h2>
         <p>Most scopes produce about 0-5 V square wave on the "PROBE
         COMP" pins to use for testing. We will use this to get familiar
         with triggering the scope. The trigger level controls the
         voltage at which the trace starts. Stability is lost when the
         trigger level lies outside the range of the displayed
         voltage.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Connect the Probe Comp output to the scope using mini
         grabbers (see Figure <a href="#fig:grabber">3</a>).</p></li>
         <li><p>Display the waveform on the scope. You will need to
         trigger the scope off of the waveform. Confirm with your
         instructor that you have the scope triggered correctly before
         continuing. Change TRIGGER MODE to NORMAL. Note that the trace
         now "freezes" when the trigger level is misadjusted. You can
         see whether or not the scope is actually being triggered by
         looking for the small writing TRIGD or TRIG? at the top of the
         display. <em>See Appendix for the trigger menu.</em> Describe
         the setup and outcomes in your lab notebook.</p></li>
         </ol>
         <p>What is the frequency of the waveform? You can measure the
         period and then calculate the frequency using that measurement.
         Include your measurements, procedure, and calculations in your

         <p>The Keysight EDU33212A function generator can produce sine,
         square, triangle, pulse, and ramp waveforms over the
         frequencies from 0.000001 Hz to 20 MHz. The output amplitude
         can be varied between 1 mV and 20 V peak-to-peak with an output
         impedance of 50 <span
         class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>.</p>
         <p><strong><em>There is one main precaution to keep in mind: Do
         not connect any output of the EDU33212A directly to dc power or
         to the output of any other instrument or circuit. Doing so will
         burn out the output amplifier!</em></strong></p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Create a 1 V peak-to-peak (p-p) sine wave at 1 kHz with
         no DC offset (you may want to use this standard setup in the
         future if you have trouble). You will need to set the output
         termination of the function generator to HIGH Z (see
         <em>Appendix</em> or page 53 of the User Guide).</p></li>
         <li><p>Display the waveform on the scope. You can use a BNC
         cable (see Figure <a href="#fig:bnc">2</a>) to make the
         connection. You will need to trigger the scope off of the
         waveform.</p></li>
         <li><p>Reduce the amplitude to 100 mV p-p. You may notice the
         scope stopped triggering. This is because the waveform never
         crosses the trigger level now.</p></li>
         <li><p>The function generator has a trigger output that can be
         used to trigger the scope (called Sync/Trigger Out). Using the
         trigger output is more convenient than triggering the scope off
         of the waveform itself because you avoid having to readjust the
         scope trigger every time you change the waveform. Connect the
         Sync output of the function generator to Channel 4 of the scope
         and trigger off of that waveform. Now change the amplitude and
         frequency of the sine wave and notice how the scope remains
         nicely triggered.</p></li>
         <li><p>Come up with a waveform of your own that you want to
         create (e.g., triangle wave at 1 MHz with a 200 mV p-p
         amplitude) and measure its properties with the scope. Report on
         the one you created and record this in your lab notebook. You
         can either print a screenshot directly from the scope or take a
         picture and print it.</p></li>

         with the Digital Multimeter</h1>
         <p><strong>The multimeter is a useful device to measure
         constant voltages, currents, and resistances.</strong></p>
         <p>To measure various quantities with the DMM, you must set the
         dial on the DMM to the correct setting that you want to
         measure. The Fluke 115 DMM that is in your toolbox at your
         workbench has three banana jack input ports at the bottom.
         Based on the quantity that you want to measure (voltage,
         current, resistance, etc.), you need to be sure that you’ve
         installed the leads into the appropriate input ports (NOTE: one
         of the leads will always be connected to the
         <strong>COM</strong> port).</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Connect the leads and set the dial to measure
         resistance. Get five ~5 <span class="math inline">\(k
         \Omega\)</span> (5%) resistors from the stock drawers. Measure
         the resistance of each resistor. Do all the resistors meet the
         5% specification?</p></li>
         <li><p>Connect the leads and set the dial to measure voltage.
         Measure the voltage of both sides of the DC power supply again.
         Does the measured value from the DMM agree with the value
         indicated on the power supply?</p></li>
         <li><p>Now we will use the DMM to measure the current. This is
         different from measuring the voltage. To measure current, the
         DMM must be <em>part of</em> the circuit so that the current
         flows <em>through</em> the DMM. Remember, your DMM has three
         input ports at the bottom and you need to make sure that the
         leads are set up measure current. Connect the leads or cables
         to the proper ports and set the dial to measure current.
         Measure the current produced by the power supply. How do you
         experimentally set the current limit? Does the current measured
         with the DMM agree with the current indicated on the power
         supply?</p></li>
         <li><p>The DMM also has an AC voltage setting. You will need to
         use the function generator to produce an AC (sine) waveform.
         Over what frequency range is the reading accurate to 2%? Note:
         the DMM displays the RMS amplitude of the waveform. See
         Definitions at the beginning of the guide for an explanation of
         RMS. You will also need to consider how “Amplitude” and
         “Peak-to-Peak” are related.</p></li>
         <li><p>Remember in the future that this is the usable frequency
         range for the AC setting of the multimeter. Record this
         frequency in your lab notebook for future reference.</p></li>

         a very thin amber-colored insulating coating (about 0.001” in
         thickness). Make sure you remove the insulation from the ends
         of the wire to make a good electrical connection and
         measurement of the diameter of the wire. You can burn off the

         calipers and a micrometer in the “Measuring Tools” drawer of
         the blue tool cabinet. The spool of magnet wire should be
         24-gauge. Look up a copper magnet wire gauge chart online and
