         <p><strong>Scope probe</strong> - a test probe used to increase
         the resistive impedance and lower the capacitive impedance
         compared to a simple coax cable probe.</p>
         <p><strong>Transfer function</strong> - the complex function
         <span class="math inline">\(V_{out}/V_{in}\)</span>.</p>
         <p><strong>Gain</strong> - the magnitude of the transfer
         function is the voltage gain <span
         class="math inline">\(G=|T|=|V_{out}/V_{in}|\)</span>. The
         power gain is the square of this: <span
         class="math inline">\(|V_{out}/V_{in}|^2\)</span>. If the gain
         is not specified, you can assume it is the voltage (or
         amplitude) gain.</p>
         <p><strong>Decibel (dB)</strong> - a measure of the power
         transmitted by converting the power gain (or voltage gain) to a
         logarithmic scale. The difference in power between output and
         input in decibels (dB) is <span
         class="math inline">\(10~log_{10}~|V_{out}/V_{in}|^2
         =20~log_{10}~|V_{out}/V_{in}|\)</span>. One common reference
         point is where the ratio of output to input power is 1/2, which
         is <span class="math inline">\(10~log_{10}(0.5) =
         -3~dB\)</span>. This corresponds to <span
         class="math inline">\(|V_{out}/V_{in}| = 1/\sqrt 2 = 0.707 =
         70.7\%\)</span>.</p>
         <p><strong>Pass band</strong> - the range of frequencies that
         can pass through a filter without being attenuated.</p>
         <p><strong>Attenuation band</strong> - the range of frequencies
         where the filter attenuates the signal.</p>
         <p><strong>Cutoff frequency or corner frequency or 3 dB
         frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f_c\)</span></strong> -
         frequency separating the pass and attenuation bands. It is the
         frequency at the half-power (3 dB) point, where the
         <em>power</em> transmitted is half the maximum power
         transmitted. The output voltage <em>amplitude</em> at <span
         class="math inline">\(f = f_c\)</span> is <span
         class="math inline">\(1/\sqrt{2} = 70.7\%\)</span> of the
         maximum amplitude.</p>
         <p><strong>Low-pass filter</strong> - a filter that passes low
         frequency signals and attenuates (reduces the amplitude of)
         signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. Also
         known as an integrator.</p>
         <p><strong>High-pass filter</strong> - a filter that passes
         high frequency signals and attenuates (reduces the amplitude
         of) signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency.
         Also known as a differentiator.</p>
         <p><strong>Band-pass filter</strong> - passes frequencies
         within a certain range and attenuates frequencies outside that
         range.</p>
         <p><strong>Band-pass filter bandwidth</strong> - the range of
         frequencies between the upper (<span
         class="math inline">\(f_+\)</span>) and lower (<span
         class="math inline">\(f_-\)</span>) half power (3dB) points:
         <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f = f_+ - f_-\)</span>.</p>
         <h1 data-number="3" id="application-of-filters"><span
         class="header-section-number">3</span> Application of
         Filters</h1>
         <p>A frequent problem in physical experiments is to detect an
         electronic signal when it is hidden in a background of noise
         and unwanted signals. The signal of interest may be at a
         particular frequency, as in an NMR experiment, or it may be an
         electrical pulse, as from a nuclear particle detector. The
         background generally contains thermal noise from the transducer
         and amplifier, 60 Hz power pick up, transients from machinery,
         radiation from radio and TV stations, cell phone radiation, and
         so forth. The purpose of filtering is to enhance the signal of
         interest by recognizing its characteristic time dependence and
         to reduce the unwanted background to the lowest possible level.
         A radio does this when you tune to a particular station, using
         a resonant circuit to recognize the characteristic frequency.
         The signal you want may be less than 10<sup>-6</sup> of the
         total radiation power at your antenna, yet you get a
         high-quality signal from the selected station. Many experiments
         require specific filters designed so that the signal from the
         phenomenon of interest lies in the pass-band of the filter,
         while the attenuation bands are chosen to suppress the
         background and noise.</p>
         <p>This experiment introduces you to the filtering properties
         of some widely used but simple circuits, employing only a
         resistor and capacitor for high- and low-pass filters and an
         LCR (inductor, capacitor, resistor) circuit for a band-pass
         filter.</p>
         <h1 data-number="4" id="filter-basics"><span
         class="header-section-number">4</span> Filter Basics</h1>
         <p>Whenever we discuss frequency in the lab, measured in Hz, we
         mean <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, and this is the
         most relevant. However, to avoid a bunch of factors of <span
         class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>, the angular frequency
         <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> often appears in
         theoretical derivations. Just remember that <span
         class="math inline">\(\omega = 2\pi f\)</span> so it is easy to
         convert. You should show results versus <span
         class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>
         <h2 data-number="4.1" id="rc-low--and-high-pass-filters"><span
         class="header-section-number">4.1</span> RC low- and high-pass
         filters</h2>
         <p>The response of RC low-pass and high-pass filters to sine
         waves is discussed in Steck 2.3.5 &amp; 2.3.7, H&amp;H
         1.18--1.19, and Fischer-Cripps 3.9--3.10. For these circuits,
         the magnitudes of the transfer functions are:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\left| T(f) \right| =
         \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (2\pi fRC)^{2}}}~
         \mbox{(low-pass)}\]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\left| T(f) \right| =
         \frac{2\pi fRC}{\sqrt{1 + (2\pi fRC)^{2}}}
         ~\mbox{(high-pass)}\]</span></p>
         <p>For both filters: <span class="math inline">\(f_{C} =
         1/{2\pi RC}\ \)</span>, where <span
         class="math inline">\(f_{C}\)</span> is the frequency at which
         the power drops by 3 dB (which means it is half of the
         maximum). In this lab, we are finding how efficiently signals
         of different frequencies are passed. This is called the
         frequency domain. Later, we will look at the time domain, where
         we see how the output changes as a function of time. In that
         context, low-pass and high-pass filters are called integrators
         and differentiators.</p>

         class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Parallel LCR band-pass
         filters</h2>
         <p>The LCR circuit is described in Fischer-Cripps 3.12, H&amp;H
         1.22, and Steck 2.6 (note that the Steck example is for a
         <em>serial</em> LCR circuit so the concepts are the same but
         the details are different). As this is another generalized
         voltage divider,</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_{out} = V_{in} = IZ_{2} =
         V_{in}\frac{Z_{2}}{Z_{1} + Z_{2}}\]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[Z_{1} = R\]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[Z_{2} = \frac{j\omega L}{1 -
         \omega^{2}LC}\]</span></p>
         <p>The magnitude of the transfer function can then be
         calculated as:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\left| T(\omega) \right| =
         \sqrt{\frac{V_{out}V_{out}^{*}}{V_{in}V_{in}^{*}}}\]</span></p>
         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span> indicates the
         complex conjugate. The algebra is left for you as a prelab
         exercise.</p>
         <p>The resonant frequency, <span
         class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>, and quality factor, or
         <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> factor, are given
         by:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[f_{0} =
         \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}\]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[Q = \omega_{0}RC =
         \frac{R\sqrt{C}}{\sqrt{L}} = \frac{f_{0}}{\Delta
         f}\]</span></p>
         <p>The resonant frequency, <span
         class="math inline">\(f_{0}\)</span>, is the center frequency
         of the pass band, and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is
         equal to the ratio of the center frequency to the bandwidth
         <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f\)</span>. (These
         definitions are exactly true only for <span
         class="math inline">\(Q\gg1\)</span>).</p>
         <p>For a resonant LCR circuit the characteristic impedance,
         <span class="math inline">\(Z_0\)</span>, is the magnitude of
         the impedance of the inductor or the capacitor at the resonant
         frequency:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[Z_{0} = \omega_{0}L =

         the gain (<span class="math inline">\(V_{out}/V_{in}\)</span>)
         versus frequency, similar to what is on pages 61 &amp; 62 of
         Steck (although the Steck plots have the x-axis in units of
         <span class="math inline">\(2\pi RC\)</span> and you should use
         units of Hz). Make sure to include a large enough range in
         frequency to see both the pass and attenuation bands. Make sure
         to label your axes! Details about making plots nice are
         included in Lab Skills Activity 2.</p></li>
         <li><p>During the lab section, you will enter your measurements
         into your Mathematica notebook and plot them with your model
         predictions. To prepare for this, create a list of “fake data”
         and plot it on your Bode plots. This will allow you to compare
         your model and measurements in real time avoiding lost time
         taking lots of data when something is wrong with your circuit.
         The point of this part is just to have you create working code
         to enter a list of data and plot it along with the function.
         The numerical values of the fake date are unimportant. There is
         a helpful guide on Canvas about plotting data and theory
         together in Mathematica in the Mathematica Resources
