         <p>In the last lab you used op-amps for the first time and applied negative feedback to the op-amp in order to make useful and stable circuits. You built:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>a <em>voltage buffer</em> in order to apply a voltage with a very low output impedance</li>
         <li>a <em>non-inverting amplifier</em> to boost a small signal</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Now, you will build more op-amp circuits with negative feedback.</p>
         <p>In this lab, you will build:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>an inverting amplifier and explore one of its major limitations (its input impedance)</p></li>
         <li><p>a summing amplifier designed to act as a digital-to-analog converter (DAC)</p></li>
         <li><p>a signal integrator to integrate a signal over time</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>These three circuits have many applications. The inverting amplifier is like the non-inverting amplifier but with one advantage and one disadvantage. You will use the summing amplifier to build a DAC, but there are many applications of summing amplifiers in mixing signals. Finally the integrator has many uses and is commonly used to convert different wave-shapes in audio applications, and it is also used in control systems.</p>
         <p>In this lab you will:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>refine your ability to design and analyze op-amp circuits with negative feedback</p></li>
         <li><p>develop more independence in designing, modeling, building, and characterizing circuits</p></li>
         </ul>
         <h1 data-number="2" id="op-amp-review"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Op-amp Review</h1>
         <p>This section summarizes information covered in lab 4 (you may find this useful for a quick reference in the future).</p>
         <p>The op-amp is a differential amplifier that outputs an amplified difference between the inputs:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{out}=A(V_+-V_-)\]</span></p>
         <p>Feeding the output back into the inverting input drives the system into a very stable state which no longer depends on many of the details or imperfections of the internal workings. <em>Closed-loop</em> refers to the state of an op-amp with feedback, and <em>open-loop</em> refers to the state of an op-amp with no feedback.</p>
         <h2 data-number="2.1" id="golden-rules"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Golden Rules</h2>
         <p>The golden rules are approximations that make op-amp analysis relatively simple and straight forward.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>The open-loop gain is infinitely large: <span class="math display">\[A\rightarrow\infty\]</span></li>
         <li>The input impedance is infinitely large, so no current flows in or out of the inputs: <span class="math display">\[I_+=I_-=0\]</span></li>
         <li>When negative feedback is applied, the output drives the inverting input to be the same voltage as the non-inverting input: <span class="math display">\[V_+=V_-\]</span></li>
         </ol>
         <h2 data-number="2.2" id="definitions"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Definitions</h2>
         <p>Here are all the terms we defined in the prelab from lab 4:</p>
         <p><strong>Open-loop gain, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span></strong> - the gain of the op-amp when there is no feedback.</p>
         <p><strong>Open-loop DC gain, <span class="math inline">\(A_\text{VOL}\)</span></strong> - the open-loop gain at low frequencies before the frequency dependence starts to take over and the open-loop gain starts to decrease. This is cited in any op-amp datasheet (sometimes as <span class="math inline">\(A_\text{OL}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(A_\text{VO}\)</span>).</p>
         <p><strong>Open-loop 3 dB point, <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span></strong> - the frequency that the open-loop gain falls -3 dB from <span class="math inline">\(A_\text{VOL}\)</span>. Beyond this frequency, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> typically continues to fall with a constant dB per log-scale (quoted in dB/octave (log2) or dB/decade (log10)). This value is usually <strong><em>not</em></strong> quoted in datasheets. It can be calculated from other values, and people often aren’t concerned with the value of <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>.</p>
         <p><strong>Closed-loop gain, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span></strong> - when a fraction of the output is fed back into the inverting input <span class="math inline">\(V_-\)</span>, the op-amp’s gain is greatly reduced from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to some value <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Just like the open-loop gain, this value is frequency dependent and starts to fall from <span class="math inline">\(G_0\)</span> near the 3 dB point, <span class="math inline">\(f_B\)</span>.</p>
         <p><strong>Closed-loop DC gain, <span class="math inline">\(G_0\)</span></strong> - the closed-loop gain at frequencies well below the 3 dB point. Except in active filter design, the point of an op-amp is to operate at a frequency such that <span class="math inline">\(G(f)=G_0\)</span>, so almost always, the closed-loop DC gain is referred to simply as <strong><em>THE</em> gain</strong>.</p>
         <p><strong>3 dB point, <span class="math inline">\(f_B\)</span></strong> - the frequency where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> drops -3 dB from <span class="math inline">\(G_0\)</span>. This is also often referred to as the bandwidth or operating bandwidth, as typical operation should be done below this frequency.</p>
         <p><strong>Gain bandwidth product, <span class="math inline">\(\text{GBW}\)</span></strong> - the product of the DC gain and the 3 dB point is a constant value. This should be cited in datasheets as it’s a foundational property of each op-amp’s internal design. Just like resistor values, however, the precise <span class="math inline">\(\text{GBW}\)</span> varies from op-amp to op-amp of the same name.</p>
         <p><strong>Unity gain frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span></strong> - the 3 dB point when the gain is 1 (unity). Since this is mathematically equivalent to the <span class="math inline">\(\text{GBW}\)</span>, these terms are often used interchangeably.</p>
         <p><strong>Capacitive coupling</strong> - capacitive coupling is the process of sending a signal or energy through a capacitor (remember that the impedance of a capacitor is inversely proportional to the frequency). Capacitive coupling is a way of sending AC while blocking DC. Parasitic capacitance often leads to this happening by mistake.</p>
         <p><strong>Decoupling capacitor</strong> - decoupling is coupling to ground. Decoupling capacitors charge up and provide a reservoir of energy that can be supplied to the circuit as the circuit’s current draw changes over time. Power supplies and transmission lines have inherent inductance which impedes changes in current, <span class="math inline">\(dI/dt\)</span>, so the decoupling capacitors compensate with the energy stored and provide the current necessary to maintain constant voltage.</p>

         <h2 data-number="3.1" id="inverting-amplifier"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Inverting Amplifier</h2>
         <div id="fig:invamp" class="fignos">
         <figure>

         </div>
         <p>The inverting amplifier is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:invamp">1</a>. Notice that this is very similar to the non-inverting amplifier, except for the fact that the input and ground are swapped.</p>
         <p>There is still a voltage divider network feeding the output back to the inverting input with a transfer function <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, such that</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[B=\frac{R}{R_F+R}\]</span></p>
         <p>This simple swapping of the input and ground changes a few properties of the amplifier circuit</p>
         <ul>
         <li>the gain is now negative (the signal inverts i.e. flips upside down),</li>
         <li>the input impedance is greatly reduced.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The reduced input impedance has potential issues; however, there is one advantage of the inverting amplifier. Because one of the inputs is held at a constant voltage (ground), the voltage at the inputs barely fluctuates which puts less strain on the op-amp resulting in better performance in reproducing the output waveform.</p>
         <h3 data-number="3.1.1" id="sec:1.1"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Prelab Question</h3>
         <p>Applying the voltage golden rule, it should be clear that the voltage at both inputs is <span class="math inline">\(0\text{ V}\)</span>. Even though the voltage at <span class="math inline">\(V_-\)</span> is zero, it is called a <strong>virtual ground</strong>, instead of <strong>ground</strong>, because there is no actual path to <em>Earth ground</em>, so it does not serve the full function of ground.</p>
         <p>Since the path from <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{in}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(V_-\)</span> is like a path to ground, this path is like a load. With this knowledge, what do you think the input impedance of the inverting amplifier is?</p>

         <p>By only using the current golden rule, the <em>closed-loop gain</em> of the inverting amplifier can be derived even with a finite <em>open-loop gain</em> <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
         <p>The current golden rule, says that no current flows into <span class="math inline">\(V_-\)</span>, so all the current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> that flows through <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> will also flow through <span class="math inline">\(R_F\)</span> (see <a href="#fig:invamp-finite">2</a>).</p>
         <p>Second, plugging <span class="math inline">\(V_+=0\)</span> into the op-amp equation</p>

         <p><span class="math display">\[V_-=\frac{-V_\text{out}}{A}\]</span></p>
         <!-- Note that $$\lim_{A\rightarrow\infty}V_-=0$$ which is what the voltage golden rule says should happen with negative feedback and infinite open-loop gain. **This is the virtual ground**.-->

         <p>Formulas for the input and output impedance for an inverting amplifier are derived in Horowitz and Hill 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. section 4.26 (copies can be found in the lab).</p>

         <p>The Summing Amplifier, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:sumamp">4</a>, is a very flexible circuit. Notice that it is just like the inverting amplifier op-amp configuration, but it has multiple inputs coming together at the inverting input. Since <span class="math inline">\(V_-\)</span> is a <em>virtual ground</em>, each input <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> with input voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span> has an input impedance of <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span>.</p>
         <p>Each input has a current through it which can be determined with Kircchoff’s voltage law</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_i - I_iR_i=0\]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[I_i = \frac{V_i}{R_i}\]</span></p>
         <p>All of these current paths combine near the inverting input before going through <span class="math inline">\(R_F\)</span>; by Kircchoff’s current law, the current through <span class="math inline">\(R_F\)</span> is the sum of all of these input currents</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[I_F = \sum_{i=1}^n I_i=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{V_i}{R_i}\]</span></p>
         <p>Finally, the voltage rise from the <em>virtual ground</em> to <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span> can be calculated by Kircchoff’s voltage law</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{out} = 0-R_FI_F =  -R_F\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{V_i}{R_i}\]</span></p>
         <p><em>Note:</em> If you have the same input source, like the function generator, going into multiple inputs, it will have to supply current to all of these. Sources of current have current limits, and splitting the current into too many outputs can make it quickly reach its current limit.</p>

         <p>In the lab, you will use a summing amplifier to build a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). This is one of the many incredibly useful applications of the summing amplifier. In order to design the circuit, you will need to have some understanding of binary numbers (in digital circuits, all numbers are in binary). In binary there are only two states: 0 and 1 (aka <strong>false</strong> and <strong>true</strong> or <strong>off</strong> and <strong>on</strong>). In digital circuits, the 1 state is usually <span class="math inline">\(5\text{ V}\)</span> (but <span class="math inline">\(3.3\text{ V}\)</span> is also common).</p>
         <p>You may or may not have experience with binary-decimal conversions, but it’s pretty straight forward. A binary number like</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[101101\]</span></p>
         <p>can be converted by knowing that each bit of a binary number represents <span class="math inline">\(2^i\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is represents a bit’s place, so the number above is</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[1\cdot2^5+0\cdot2^4+1\cdot2^3+1\cdot2^2+0\cdot2^1+1\cdot2^0\]</span></p>

         <p>You will build a 3-bit DAC; this means that it will be able to convert 3 digit binary numbers (in binary, digits are referred to as bits).</p>
         <p><strong>Make a table</strong> with all 8 possible 3-bit binary numbers on the left and the corresponding decimal equivalents on the right. For example: 000 in binary is 0 in decimal.

         The sine wave analysis is the easiest because the integral of a sine wave is a sine wave (remember that sine and cosine are the same thing with phase shifts). If $V_\text{in}$ has an amplitude $V_0$ and frequency $f$, then

         $$V_\text{out}(t) = \frac{-1}{RC}\int_0^{t} V_0 \sin{(2\pi f t')}\; dt'$$

         Evaluate the integral to determine

         1.  $V_\text{out}$ over the full period $T=1/f$. Does this result make sense for an oscillating output?

         2.  $V_\text{out}$ over the half the period.

         3.  Use your previous results to determine the amplitude of the output wave

         4.  Use the peak-to-peak amplitude of $V_\text{in}$ and $V_\text{out}$ to determine the gain of the circuit for a square wave input. Express this in terms of $f$ instead of $T$.

         ### Prelab Question {#sec:6.2}

         <p>so we can treat the capacitor in the circuit as an element with this impedance. In this case, using the same analysis that was done on the inverting amplifier, the equations found with Kircchoff’s voltage law become</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{in}+IR=0\]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{out}-\frac{I}{j\omega C}=0\]</span></p>
         <p>Remembering that <span class="math inline">\(j=\exp(j\pi/2)\)</span>, the gain can be written</p>

         <p>Note that this treatment for the gain works on individual sine wave components.

         <p>The complex exponential in the gain has a phase of <span class="math inline">\(\phi=-\frac{\pi}{2}\)</span>; this means that the gain will phase shift the output by this much.

         <p>Notice that the gain falls off as a function of frequency. This makes it act like a low-pass filter.

         <p>Choosing values for the resistor and capacitor depends on several considerations. First, one needs to determine the desired RC time constant. This will depend on the expected signal (size, shape, and frequency), and the desired output (remembering the op-amp limitations on maximum output voltage and slew rate). Once <span class="math inline">\(RC\)</span> is determined, some considerations for choosing <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> are:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>For this application, non-polarized capacitors should be selected because the applied voltage will oscillate around <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p></li>
         <li><p>Availability: resistors from <span class="math inline">\(1\ \Omega\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(10\text{ M}\Omega\)</span> and non-polarized capacitors from <span class="math inline">\(2\text{ pF}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1\ \text{μF}\)</span> are readily available in the lab.</p></li>
         <li><p>Input impedance: generally a high input impedance is desired to avoid voltage dividing the input signal with the <span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span> output impedance of the function generator. <span class="math inline">\(1\text{ k}\Omega\)</span> input impedance will have a transfer function of <span class="math inline">\(0.952\)</span> voltage dividing with <span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span>, and it is recommended to have at least this much input impedance (but more is better).</p></li>
         <li><p>Avoiding stray capacitance effects: there are many sources of capacitance, such as cables, which can unintentionally couple to or decouple your signal. For this reason, it is advisable to avoid very small capacitors as the stray capacitances may end up dominating. A few hundred picofarads should be sufficient.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p><strong>Dealing with DC offsets:</strong> A DC offset, however small, integrates to a linear growth over time (the capacitor builds up charge) which will cause the output to hit one of the op-amp’s maximum output voltages. Op-amps usually have small DC offsets even if the input signal has no offset. One way to mitigate this is to add a resistor in parallel with the capacitor so that charge can leak out of the capacitor overtime.</p>
         <p>A real capacitor can be accurately modeled as an ideal capacitor with resistance in series and in parallel with it (see Figure <a href="#fig:cap-measure">6</a>). Good capacitors have very small series resistance and very large parallel resistance. The parallel resistance often has to do with the dielectric material inside “leaking” charge through it. When the LCR meter is used to measure a capcitance, it is unable to apply the series+parallel resistance model with a single measurement; it can be set to either measure with a parallel resistance model <em>or</em> a series resistance model (see Figure <a href="#fig:LCR">7</a>). For this application in particular, it is a good idea to measure the capacitor with a parallel resistance model so that you know how much resistance should be added in parallel to reach a specific parallel resistance to get the right amount of “leakage.”</p>

         <p>In this lab, we will use ICs (integrated circuits) for the second time. Here’s a review of the tips from last lab. <strong>Read through them all</strong> again before you begin using any IC chips. You should refer back to this section in future labs to remind yourself of these useful tips.</p>

         </div>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Always unplug the power supply from your circuit while you’re wiring it.</p></li>
         <li><p>Chips sit across the groove on the breadboard (see Figure <a href="#fig:power-example">8</a>). Any other placement will cause legs to short together.</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Before inserting a chip, ensure the pins are straight (using a needle-nose pliers or something similar).</p></li>
         <li><p>After insertion, check visually that no pin is broken or bent under the chip.</p></li>
         <li><p>To remove the chip, use the dedicated IC pliers (found in the tool trays at your lab station). Removing ICs by hand often results in bent legs and/or a leg puncturing your finger.</p></li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><p>Use the long columns on your breadboard for your power and ground voltages (with power and ground next to each other) to take advantage of the parasitic decoupling capacitance of the long line.</p></li>
         <li><p>Color code your wires. We recommend:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p><span style="color: black;">0V (ground) Black</span></p></li>
         <li><p><span style="color: red;">+15V Red</span></p></li>
         <li><p><span style="color: blue;">-15V Blue</span></p></li>
         <li><p>Use other colors for any other connections which aren’t to <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> power or ground</p></li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><p>Connect capacitors between the power pin(s) of the IC (as close to the pin as possible as in Figure <a href="#fig:power-example">8</a>) to ground. These are called decoupling or bypass capacitors and are critical for maintaining constant voltage at the pin as the current needs change. Use nice, big polarized (electrolytic) capacitors (<span class="math inline">\(&gt;1\ \mu\text{F}\)</span>) so that they’re able to collect enough charge to deliver the necessary current when needed.</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure all your passive elements (resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes) before putting them in the circuits; trying to measure while they are plugged into the breadboard can lead to mistakes.</p></li>
         <li><p>Always have a diagram of your circuit with pin numbers labeled (like the left side of Figure <a href="#fig:pin-diagram">9</a>).</p></li>
         <li><p>Make sure any polarized (electrolytic) capacitors are oriented such that the higher voltage is applied to the correct lead of the capacitor. Remember: <strong>ground</strong> is a <strong><em>HIGHER</em></strong> voltage than <span class="math inline">\(-15\ \text{V}\)</span>. Getting this backward will cause the capacitor to explode: this is loud, smelly, and a bit embarrassing.</p></li>
         <li><p>Wires that your signal go through should be kept short and compact. This minimizes the parasitic inductance and capacitance and will better preserve the signal. Don’t put your signals into the long columns running down the breadboard.</p></li>
         <li><p>Don’t make any connections that cross over the top of the IC (like the feedback connection for an op-amp); instead, go around the IC.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>This makes it so you can pull out the IC without disturbing the rest of the circuit.</p></li>
         <li><p>This helps ensure magnetic fields generated by the current in the wire don’t interact with the inner workings of the IC.</p></li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>Compare your physical circuit to the diagram before connecting the power supply (especially polarized capacitor orientations).</p></li>

         <p>By now, you should be somewhat comfortable with experimental design and reporting of outcomes, especially with op-amps and voltage dividers. In this last section, you will design and characterize an integrator. Your starting point should be the integrator circuit you designed in the prelab. Here are some things to consider and items you may wish to include in your lab notebook:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>The integration is over <em>time</em>.</p></li>
         <li><p>Describe the circuit you are building and testing (design your integrator for the conditions detailed in the prelab).</p></li>
         <li><p>Draw the schematic of the circuit with component values labeled (don’t forget to measure the parallel resistance of your capacitor).</p></li>
         <li><p>Design for a parallel resistance of ~<span class="math inline">\(800\text{ k}\Omega\)</span> for the capacitor. Factor in the capacitor’s measured parallel resistance for targeting this value.</p></li>
         <li><p>List your predictions / models. It is fine to start by using ideal models.</p></li>
         <li><p>How do you plan to test it? Be sure to use square, triangle, and sine waves at various frequencies.</p></li>
         <li><p>Use sine waves to test the gain at <span class="math inline">\(1\text{ kHz}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(10\text{ kHz}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(100\text{ kHz}\)</span></p></li>
         <li><p>Do the results match your model? What didn’t match?</p></li>
         <li><p>How would you refine your model or physical system to get better agreement? <em>Hint:</em> We didn’t consider the parallel resistance in the model. How could you modify analysis above to consider this resistance in your model? Can you correct any major discrepancies between your measured results and the original model?</p></li>
         </ul>
         <h2 data-number="6.4" id="the-differentiator-amplifier"><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> The Differentiator Amplifier</h2>
         <p>We did not cover this in the prelab, but as you may be able to guess, by swapping the input resistor and the feedback capacitor (to an input capacitor and a feedback resistor), instead of integrating the signal, you will differentiate the signal</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{out} = - RC \frac{dV_\text{in}}{dt}\]</span></p>
         <p>Differentiator amplifiers, like integrators are used to shape waveforms and in control systems. They can also be used in analog computing applications to solve differential equations (final project idea?).</p>
         <p>In this case, the input impedance is related to the impedance of the capacitor (it’s the magnitude of the complex impedance)</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[R&#39;_i \approx \frac{1}{2\pi f C}\]</span></p>
         <p>This means to get at least <span class="math inline">\(10\text{ k}\Omega\)</span> of input impedance at <span class="math inline">\(1\text{ kHz}\)</span>, the capacitance should be no more than <span class="math inline">\(16\text{ nF}\)</span>.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Is your choice of capacitor sufficiently small for <span class="math inline">\(1\text{ kHz}\)</span>? (i.e. will there be enough input impedance).</p></li>
         <li><p>Swap your resistor and capacitor and test a triangle wave input at <span class="math inline">\(1\text{ kHz}\)</span> to confirm that this circuit takes the time derivative of the input.</p></li>
