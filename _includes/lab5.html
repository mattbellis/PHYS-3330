         <p>The basic inverting amplifier is shown in Figure <a
         href="#fig:invamp">1</a>. We can use the Golden Rules to
         determine the low-frequency gain. Since the positive input is
         grounded, the op-amp will do everything it can to keep the
         negative input at ground as well. In the limit of infinite open
         loop gain the inverting input of the op-amp is a <u>virtual
         ground</u>, a circuit node that will stay at ground as long as
         the circuit is working, even though it is not directly
         connected to ground. When <strong><em>A is
         infinite,</em></strong> the gain of an inverting amplifier
         is</p>
         <p><span
         class="math display">\[G_0=\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}=-\frac{R_f}{R}\]</span></p>
         <p>This is the "Golden Rule" result. For the frequency
         dependence of the gain we need to consider what happens when
         <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is not infinite, as we
         did for the non-inverting case. We use the same definitions as
         for the non-inverting case. The op-amp open loop gain is <span
         class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and the divider ratio <span
         class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the same as before:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[B=\frac{R}{R+R_f}\]</span></p>
         <p>When <strong><em>A is finite</em></strong> the gain for an
         inverting amplifier is given by</p>
         <p><span
         class="math display">\[G_0=\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}=-\frac{A(1-B)}{1+AB}\]</span></p>
         <p>The above formulas are still correct when <span
         class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and/or <span
         class="math inline">\(B\)</span> depend on frequency. <span
         class="math inline">\(B\)</span> will be frequency independent
         if we only have resistors (in other cases that use complex
         impedance it may not be), but <span
         class="math inline">\(A\)</span> always varies with frequency.
         For most op-amps, including the LF356, the open loop gain
         varies with frequency like an RC low-pass filter:</p>
         <p><span
         class="math display">\[A(f)=\frac{A_0}{1+j\frac{f}{f_0}}\]</span></p>
         <p>The 3 B frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>,
         is usually very low, around 10 Hz. Data sheets do not usually
         give <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> directly; instead
         they give the DC gain, <span
         class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, and the unity gain
         frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span>, which is
         the frequency where the magnitude of the open loop gain <span
         class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is equal to one. The relation
         between <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, <span
         class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>, and <span
         class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span> is</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[f_{T} = A_{0}f_{0}\]</span></p>
         <p>The frequency dependence of the closed loop gain <span
         class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is then given by</p>
         <p><span
         class="math display">\[G=\frac{G_0}{1+j\frac{f}{f_B}}\]</span></p>
         <p>The frequency response of the amplifier with feedback is
         therefore also the same as for an RC low-pass filter.</p>

         class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Input and output
         impedances of inverting amplifiers</h2>
         <p>Formulas for the input and output impedance for an inverting
         amplifier are derived in H&amp;H Section 4.26. When the open
         loop gain is large, the negative input of the op-amp is a
         virtual ground and so the input impedance is just equal to
         <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. This is very different
         from the non-inverting case where the input impedance is
         proportional to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> for
         large <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. In practice, the
         input impedance of an inverting amplifier is not usually
         greater than about 100 k<span
         class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, while the input
         impedance of a non-inverting amplifier can easily be as large
         as 10<sup>12</sup> <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>.
         When <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is not large the
         formulas for the input impedance and output impedance of the
         entire circuit are derived in H&amp;H Section 4.26. The results
         are</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[R_{i}^{&#39;} = R +
         \frac{R_{f}}{1 + A}\]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[R_{o}^{&#39;} = \frac{R_{o}}{(1
         + AB)}\]</span></p>
         <p>The output impedance is the same for both the inverting and
         non-inverting amplifiers.</p>
         <p>The gain-bandwidth product for inverting amplifier is
         slightly modified compared to non-inverting amps.</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[A_0 f_0 = \frac{-G_0 f_B}{1 -
         B} = f_T\]</span></p>
         <p>This is the same (except for the sign) as the non-inverting
         result when the closed loop gain is large (<span
         class="math inline">\(B \ll 1, |G0| \gg 1\)</span>), but at
         unity closed loop gain (<span class="math inline">\(B = 1/2,
         G_0 = -1\)</span>) the inverting amplifier has only half as
         much bandwidth as a non-inverting amplifier.</p>

         <p>The Summing Amplifier, shown in Figure <a
         href="#fig:sumamp">2</a>, is a very flexible circuit based upon
         the standard inverting op-amp configuration that can be used
         for combining multiple inputs. The standard inverting
         amplifier, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:invamp">1</a>, has a
         single input voltage, <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{in}\)</span>, applied to the inverting
         input terminal. If we add more input resistors to the input,
         the circuit can become a voltage adder with different gain for
         each input. There are many applications for summing amplifiers
         including audio mixers and digital to analog converters. Using
         the Golden Rules we can determine the transfer function listed
         below.</p>
         <p><span

         <p>This circuit has many applications including working as an
         adder in any basis-set you specify. If you only restrict
         yourself to input voltages of 0 or 1 V (or on and off), you get
         to a binary adder and can convert binary signals to analog
         (e.g. base 2 to base 10). Digital-to-analog converters are
         found in every research lab (or computer, or phone, etc.) where
         you want to create any value of a signal from just 1’s and 0’s.

         </div>
         <p>The basic op-amp integrator is shown in Figure <a
         href="#fig:integrator">3</a>. As compared to the inverting
         amplifier in Figure <a href="#fig:invamp">1</a>, the only
         change is a replacement of the feedback resistor <span
         class="math inline">\(R_F\)</span> with a capacitor <span
         class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. An integrator is the same
         circuit as a low-pass filter. If you are interested in what
         frequencies get passed, you call it a low-pass filter. If you
         are interested in integrating the input signal, you call it an
         integrator. We can understand how the integrator works by
         applying the Golden Rules and remembering the defining equation
         for capacitors. Just as in the integrating amplifier, the
         Golden Rules tells us that <span
         class="math inline">\(V_-\approx V_+ = 0\)</span> and that the
         current across both components is the same because no current
         flows into the op-amp. We label <span
         class="math inline">\(I_R\)</span> as the current through the
         resistor, which is <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{in}/R\)</span> since <span
         class="math inline">\(V_-\)</span> is at ground. We label <span
         class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> as the current across the
         capacitor. The defining equation for capacitors is <span
         class="math inline">\(Q=CV\)</span>. The current through a
         capacitor is <span class="math inline">\(I=dQ/dt = d(CV)/dt =
         CdV/dt\)</span>. Therefore, the equation <span
         class="math inline">\(I_R=I_C\)</span> becomes:</p>
         <p><span
         class="math display">\[\frac{V_{in}}{R}=-C~\frac{dV_{out}}{dt}\]</span></p>
         <p>Solving this equation for <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{out}\)</span> gives the following:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_{out}=-\frac{1}{RC}\int
         V_{in} ~dt\]</span></p>
         <p>This is why it is called an integrator. Choosing values for
         the resistor and capacitor depends on several considerations.
         First, one needs to determine the value of the product <span
         class="math inline">\(RC\)</span>. This will depend on the
         expected signal (size and shape), the expected integration
         time, and the desired output (remembering the op-amp
         limitations on maximum output voltage and slew rate). Once
         <span class="math inline">\(RC\)</span> is determined, some
         considerations for choosing <span
         class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and <span
         class="math inline">\(C\)</span> are:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Availability: resistors from 1 <span
         class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> to 10 M<span
         class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> and capacitors from 2 pF
         to 1 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>F are readily
         available.</p></li>
         <li><p>Input impedance: generally a high input impedance (&gt;
         1 k<span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>) is desired to
         avoid loading the input signal.</p></li>
         <li><p>Avoiding effect of stray capacitance: there are many
         sources of capacitance, such as cables, which can
         unintentionally couple to your circuit. For this reason, it is
         advisable to avoid very small capacitors as the stray
         capacitances may end up dominating. A few hundred pF should be
         sufficient.</p></li>
         <li><p>Dealing with DC signal: A DC signal in the input results
         in the capacitor eventually charging up to the<br />
         maximum output voltage of the op-amp. This DC signal can result
         from the op-amp. One way to mitigate this is to add another
         resistor in parallel with the capacitor such that at low
         frequencies (large impedance in capacitor) the circuit acts
         like an inverting amplifier. As the impedance of a resistor is
         proportional to <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> while
         the impedance of a capacitor is inversely proportional to <span
         class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, to ensure that the signal
         mainly goes through the capacitor, one would like large
         resistor and/or large capacitor values. Of course, the resistor
         chosen here in combination to the main resistor in the circuit
         leads to a DC gain as calculated for the inverting amplifier so
         this should be considered in making your choice. You can
         alternatively try placing the high impedance resistor between
         <span class="math inline">\(V_{out}\)</span> and ground instead
         of in parallel with the capacitor.</p></li>

         <p><strong>These are reminders of the basics steps you should
         always follow when working with op-amps.</strong></p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>This experiment will use both +15 V and –15 V to power
         the LF356 op-amp. <span style="color: red;">Make sure you
         <strong>unplug</strong> the DC supplies while wiring your
         op-amp (you may find it useful to plug them into their own
         power strip). Everyone makes mistakes in wiring-up circuits.
         You should always check your circuit over before applying
         power.</span> Figure <a href="#fig:lf356">4</a> shows a pin-out
         for the LF356 chip. Familiarize yourself with the layout. The
         following procedure will help you wire up a circuit
         accurately:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Draw a complete schematic in your lab notebook,
         including all ground and power connections, and all IC pin
         numbers. Try to layout your prototype so the parts are arranged
         in the same way as on the schematic, as far as
         possible.</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure all resistor values before putting them in the
         circuit. Make sure you are using the correct capacitors. Some
         capacitors indicate the capacitance directly, but small
         capacitors usually just have a number where 10 = 10 pF, 102 =
         10x10<sup>2</sup> pF = 1 nF, 103 = 10x10<sup>3</sup> = 10 nF,
         104 = 10x10<sup>4</sup> pF = 100 nF. Also, see the important
         note below about polarized capacitors.</p></li>
         <li><p>Adhere to a color code for wires. For example:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p><span style="color: black;">0V (ground)
         Black</span></p></li>
         <li><p><span style="color: red;">+15V Red</span></p></li>
         <li><p><span style="color: blue;">-15V Blue</span></p></li>
         </ul></li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>The op-amp chip sits across a groove in the prototyping
         board (see Figure <a href="#fig:pb">5</a>). Before inserting a
         chip, ensure the pins are straight (using a needle-nose pliers
         or something similar). After insertion, check visually that no
         pin is broken or bent under the chip. To remove the chip, use a
         small screwdriver in the groove to pry it out.</p></li>
         <li><p>You will have less trouble with spontaneous oscillations
         if the circuit layout is neat and compact, in particular the
         feedback path should be as short as possible to reduce unwanted
         capacitive coupling (see Figure <a href="#fig:pb">5</a>). Also,
         wire around the chip rather than over it.</p></li>
         <li><p>To help prevent spontaneous oscillations due to
         unintended coupling via the power supplies, use bypass
         capacitors to filter the power supply lines. A bypass capacitor
         between each power supply lead and ground will provide a
         miniature current “reservoir” that can quickly supply current
         when needed. This capacitor is normally in the range 1-10 µF.
         <span style="color: red;">Compact capacitors in this range are
         usually <strong><em>polarized</em></strong>, meaning that one
         terminal must always be positive relative to the other. If you
         put a polarized capacitor in backwards, it will burn
         out.</span> You will probably hear a pop and smell something
         foul. Please don’t do this. The negative side should have an
         arrow on the capacitor. Also, the positive side should have a
         longer lead but this is not a good identification method as the
         leads can (and should) be cut. Bypass capacitors should be
         placed close to the op-amp pins. If you are connecting the +15
         V supply to ground, the negative capacitor lead is connected to
         ground and the positive lead is connected to +15 V. If you are
         connecting the -15 V supply to ground, the negative capacitor
         lead is connected to -15 V and the positive lead is connected
         to ground.</p></li>
