class="header-section-number">5</span> Setting Up Your Prototyping
Board</h1>
<p>Before breadboards (aka prototyping or proto boards), creating
circuits required soldering all components together, and changing the
circuit was difficult. Breadboards allow for quickly creating and
modifying circuits, with no soldering. Once the circuit works and meets
the desired specifications, the circuit can be built using more
permanent methods such as soldering to a Vector board or to a printed
circuit board. Present technology allows anyone to cheaply design,
layout, and print professional circuit boards. For example: <a

<h2 data-number="5.1" id="test-your-protoboard"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Test your protoboard</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Your instructor will give your team a prototyping board to use.
Write your team members names on it. Your team will use the same board
all semester. An incomplete experiment can be left on the board and
finished later. Store the board on the shelf labeled for your
section.</p></li>
<li><p>On the front panel, you will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>BNC cable jacks that carry electric signals between your circuit on
the board and the function generator and oscilloscope</li>
<li>Colored banana jacks to bring in DC power for transistors or chips
from an external power supply</li>
<li>A precision 10 k<span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> ten‑turn
potentiometer</li>
<li>Several switches</li>
</ul>
<p>A wire or component on the board might be broken, or might break
during the semester. Dont worry -you will be able to repair the board as
you go.</p></li>
<li><p>The breadboard contains arrays of holes, interconnected by buried
conductors, into which components are plugged to build your circuit. In
general, you can never be sure that any two contacts are really
connected, or any wire is really continuous, unless you test it
yourself, so get into the habit of testing things.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine which holes on your protoboard are connected by using
the DMM (you may also find wires and alligator clips useful). Draw a
diagram in your lab notebook of the connections. You can refer back to
this diagram throughout the semester as you build new circuits.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a 1k resistor and measure the resistor directly with the
DMM. Now insert the resistor into two holes on the breadboard that you
know are not connected and remeasure the resistance. Now insert the
resistor into two holes on the breadboard that you know
<strong>are</strong> connected and remeasure the resistance. Explain
your results. What does this tell you about when you should measure
resistors?</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="5.2"
id="making-power-connections-to-your-protoboard"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Making power connections to
your protoboard</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>For essentially all circuits, you will need power connections
(+15 V, -15V, ground). Connect the power supply to the panel using
banana cables.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>USE A COLOR CODE FOR THE POWER CONNECTIONS!</strong>
Typically we use <strong>black = ground</strong>, <span
style="color: red;"><strong>red = +15 V</strong></span>, and <span
style="color: blue;"><strong>blue = -15 V</strong></span>. Using a
consistent color code will allow you and others to debug your circuits
quickly. You are also less likely to plug something in incorrectly and
burn up a component. Write down your color code in your lab
notebook.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have power connected to the front panel, use the wires
soldered on the back of the connectors to make connections to the board
(+15, -15, and ground). The long rails that run the length of the board
are best for distributing power to all of your components. Use these for
only power or ground.</p></li>
<li><p>Good electrical contact is essential when you plug in components
or wires. Use only 22- or 24-gauge solid wire, not stranded wire. The
22- or 24-gauge wire should make a good connection with the conductors
inside the board without slipping out easily. Push in each wire until
you feel the contacts grip. <strong>Dont force larger wires into the
protoboard. You can damage the connectors.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Reliable ground connections (0 V), readily accessible from any
point on the board, are essential to the good functioning of most
circuits. The front panel is the ground for your circuit board since the
outside of the BNC connector connects the front panel of your circuit
board to the ground of other instruments in your experiment.</p></li>

<h2 data-number="5.3" id="supplying-power-to-your-protoboard"><span
class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Supplying power to your
protoboard</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Turn on your DC power supply such that it produces +15 V and -15
V. Set the current limit to about 100 mA. This will reduce the amount of
smoke released from your components when you happen to plug in the power
incorrectly. Describe the procedure you followed to set the current
limit.</p></li>
<li><p>Measure the voltage on your protoboard rails using a DMM. You may
need to use a wire to probe the voltage if your DMM probes do not fit in
the holes. Always remember to measure voltages with respect to ground.
Record the voltages in your lab notebook.</p></li>

numerical predictions in your lab notebook.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, apply a DC voltage to the input and measure the output
voltage of your divider, first using your DMM and second using your
oscilloscope with the minigrabbers. Record your measurements. <em>Do not

each may perturb the measurement differently.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Compare the voltages you predicted to the voltages you measured.
Does your model of the voltage divider agree with each of your
measurements? Explicitly record what criteria you used to determine
whether or not the model and measurements agreed.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Complete this step only if your model and measurements did
not agree.</em> If your model and measurements did not agree, you will
have to either refine your model or your experiment. Lets start by
refining your model. Consider the input resistance of your measurement
device. Draw a circuit diagram that includes that resistance. <em>HINT:
See Figure <a href="#fig:modified-vd">2</a></em> Derive an expression
for the output voltage now including the unknown measurement device

A: Calibrating the 10-turn Potentiometer (If Needed)</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The potentiometer on the circuit board panel has three
connections. Two of the connections are at opposite end of a resistor.
The third connection is connected to a sliding "wiper."</p></li>
<li><p>Your potentiometer is actually a very precise device! You can
control the intermediate resistances at the level of 0.1% with a little
care. To understand how, examine the dial on the potentiometer. It
should have a window with a number in it, and a dial marked with a scale
that goes from 00 to 99. The digit in the window increments with each
full turn of the dial, so it represents the most significant digit of
the setting number: if it says 3 in the window and the dial reads 55,
then the setting is 355. For a 10-turn potentiometer such as yours, the
dial should be able to run from 000 to 1000 by turning the knob ten full
turns.</p></li>
<li><p>First, check if your pot is already calibrated! Turn the knob
counterclockwise until it stops. If the dial reads 000 in this position,
your pot is calibrated.</p></li>
<li><p>If the dial reads something other than 000 in this position, do
the following procedure:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Use a tiny Allen key to loosen the small set-screw on the side of
the knob.</p></li>
<li><p>Pull the entire dial off the panel.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn the inner knob that remains on your panel counterclockwise
until it stops.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn the now-detached knob until the dial reads 000.</p></li>
<li><p>Push the dial back onto the inner knob, rotating the outside of
the dial (not the knob!) counterclockwise until it snaps in place
against the panel and wont rotate. The dial should still read 000. If it
doesnt, repeat the last three steps.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Allen key to tighten the set screw. Check the calibration
again: the knob should stop at 000 and 1000.</p></li>
